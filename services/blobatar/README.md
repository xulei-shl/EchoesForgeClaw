# blobatar

Deterministic geometric blobatars from any string. No dependencies, ~4.4 KB
gzipped.

![A field of forty-odd blobatars, no two alike, each generated from an ordinary handle like alain, tove or kasper](./docs/media/crowd.png)

```sh
bun add blobatar    # npm / pnpm / yarn all work too
```

## Usage

A blobatar always stands for somebody — a user, a bot, a team, a repo — so the
value it is generated from is that somebody's `name`: a username, a display
name, an email, a handle, an id. Any string works, and the same string always
renders the same blobatar.

### React

```sh
bun add blobatar @blobatar/react
```

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/react";

<Blobatar name={user.email} size={48} />;
```

Everything but `name` is optional. Remaining props land on the underlying
element, so `className`, `alt` and the rest behave as you would expect.

### Vue

```sh
bun add blobatar @blobatar/vue
```

```html
<script setup>
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/vue";
</script>

<template>
  <Blobatar name="alain@example.com" :size="48" />
</template>
```

The same props and the same behavior as the React adapter. Anything not
declared as a prop lands on the underlying element, so `class`, `style`, `alt`
and the rest behave as you would expect.

### Svelte

```sh
bun add blobatar @blobatar/svelte
```

```svelte
<script>
  import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/svelte";
</script>

<Blobatar name="alain@example.com" size={48} />
```

Svelte 5 or newer. This package ships its component as source rather than as
built JavaScript, because a `.svelte` file only becomes renderable code inside
your own compiler — any toolchain that resolves the `svelte` export condition
handles that with no configuration, and one that does not reports an unresolved
import naming the package rather than handing your bundler a file it cannot
execute. See [ADR-0010](./docs/adr/0010-svelte-ships-source.md).

### Solid and Preact

```sh
bun add blobatar @blobatar/solid     # or @blobatar/preact
```

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/solid";

<Blobatar name={user.email} size={48} />;
```

The React section with the import swapped, which is the whole difference — each
is compiled by its own framework's JSX transform rather than re-using React's,
so `solid-js` reactivity and Preact's runtime both behave as they should.

### shadcn/ui

The registry serves shadcn's `Avatar` with a blobatar as the fallback for a
missing profile image:

```sh
npx shadcn@latest registry add @blobatar=https://blobatar.dev/r/{name}.json
npx shadcn@latest add @blobatar/avatar
```

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@/components/ui/blobatar";

<Blobatar name={user.email} src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

That `Blobatar` is not the adapter's — it takes a `src` alongside the `name`,
and everything the adapter takes goes in a `blobatar` prop. A project using both
imports one of them under another name.

It is also all that gets copied into your project: the composition, which you
own and edit. The generator stays in `blobatar` and `@blobatar/react`, installed
as ordinary dependencies — a copied-in generator would be pinned to whichever
generation you took it from, and the whole point is that a name renders the same
picture everywhere.

### Anywhere else

`blobatar()` returns SVG markup as a string, and `blobatarUri()` wraps it in a
`data:` URI for `<img src>` or `background-image`:

```ts
import { blobatar } from "blobatar";
import { blobatarUri } from "blobatar/uri";

blobatar("alain@example.com"); // '<svg xmlns="..." viewBox="0 0 100 100">…'

el.style.backgroundImage = `url("${blobatarUri(user.id)}")`;
```

The main entry also carries the palette and trait utilities. If all you do is
render, import the renderer on its own and save about a kilobyte:

```ts
import { blobatar } from "blobatar/blob";
```

### Configuring

Options are the same across every adapter and the string API. `background`, `hue`
and `tone` cover the common cases; `traits` pins any individual axis as the 0–1
position the hash would otherwise have produced:

```tsx
<Blobatar name={user.email} background="circle" hue={210} size={48} />;

// Always a sun with wide eyes — colour and everything else still per name.
blobatar(user.email, { traits: { shape: 0.95, "eye.ratio": 0 } });
```

Keys you leave out still come from the name — lock the two things that carry
your brand, and every user still gets their own creature. Pin everything and the
name stops mattering, which is how you build one fixed blobatar.

Every value those options take, and what each one draws:

![The ten silhouettes from round and organic through capsule, triangle, hexagon and droplet; the eight hue stops from 12 to 320 degrees; the fourteen expressions from idle through happy, sad and mad to love, shy, sick and thinking; the four backgrounds none, squircle, circle and square](./docs/media/sheet.png)

### Animation and expressions

Both are opt-in. `animate` idles the blobatar — breathe, bob, blink, glance —
and expressions are imported as values so you ship only the poses you use:

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/react";
import { happy } from "blobatar/expression";
import "blobatar/motion.css"; // required — nothing animates without it

<Blobatar name={user.email} animate="hover" expression={happy} size={64} />;
```

The same props work in every adapter — only the component import changes.

### Coming from `blobatar/react` or `blobatar/vue`

Those subpaths still work and render exactly the same component — the packages
above re-export them. They are deprecated and go in v3. Move whenever it suits
you:

```sh
bunx blobatar-codemod .
bun add @blobatar/react   # and/or @blobatar/vue
```

`animate` changes the rendering mode: a static blobatar is a single `<img>`, an
animated one is inline SVG. Use `"hover"` in a grid and `"always"` for the
single-blobatar case. Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Over HTTP

No install and no build step — a URL that renders one:

```html
<img src="https://blobatar.dev/avatar/alain00?size=48" width="48" height="48" alt="">
```

The path segment is the name, percent-encoded, and the query string is the
options under the names the library gives them — `size` (or `s`), `background`,
`hue`, `tone`, `expression`, `title`, `gen`:

```
https://blobatar.dev/avatar/alain%40example.com?size=64&background=squircle
https://blobatar.dev/avatar/team-rocket?expression=smug
```

Gravatar's `d`, `f` and `r` are accepted and ignored, so an existing Gravatar
URL becomes a blobatar by changing the host and nothing else:

```diff
- https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/<hash>?s=200&d=identicon
+ https://blobatar.dev/avatar/<hash>?s=200&d=identicon
```

The hash is used as the name. It is one-way, so the email cannot be recovered —
but it is itself derived from the email, so each person still gets one stable
blobatar of their own. It will not be the same one `/avatar/<email>` gives:
pick one scheme per application.

`gen` picks the shape vocabulary. New silhouettes cannot be added without
reshuffling existing ones — the thresholds partition a single range — so they
arrive as a new **generation** instead:

| | silhouettes |
| --- | --- |
| `gen=1` | round, organic, boxy, nub, cloud, sun |
| `gen=2` | …and capsule, triangle, hexagon, droplet |

An unversioned URL follows the current package major and now renders gen 2.
Pin `?gen=1` on existing URLs that must keep the original six shapes:

```
https://blobatar.dev/avatar/alain00?gen=1
https://blobatar.dev/avatar/alain00?gen=2
```

A generation that has appeared in a URL keeps answering. The list only ever
grows: `gen=1` will not be retired, redirected to a newer vocabulary, or
answered with a placeholder, because a URL that renders someone's face is
usually written down somewhere its author no longer controls. That is what
naming a generation buys, and it is why a pinned URL earns a year-long
immutable cache rather than a day — it cannot come back different. The cost
falls on the endpoint, which depends on every frozen package major it still
serves; the library itself carries only the current one.

`GET /avatar/` returns the whole parameter list as plain text, which is the
reference this section is a summary of.

### Deploy your own

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Alain00/blobatar/tree/main/apps/api)

`blobatar.dev/avatar` is free to use, but it is one small Worker rather than
something you have an agreement with, and it is rate-limited. If avatars are
load-bearing for you, run the endpoint yourself. The button clones
[`apps/api`](./apps/api) into your GitHub or GitLab account and deploys it to
your Cloudflare account — no configuration, no card, about a minute — and you
get:

```
https://blobatar-api.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/avatar/<name>
```

Attach your own hostname afterwards in the Cloudflare dashboard, or as a
`routes` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`, and every push to your clone redeploys.

It stays inside the Workers free plan for anything short of real scale:
100,000 requests a day, and a blobatar costs 12µs of CPU against the 10ms
allowed per request and 357 gzipped bytes to send. There is no database, no
bucket and no state — the avatar is a pure function of the URL, which is also
why every cache between you and it does the actual work.

[`CONTEXT.md`](./CONTEXT.md) is the glossary — worth two minutes before changing
anything, since `shape` and the `name`/`seed` split mean specific and
easily-confused things here. Architectural decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/).
