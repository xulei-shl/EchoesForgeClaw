/**
 * The endpoint film: the script it types, and the clock derived from it.
 *
 * The tweet this is cut for makes one claim — *the URL is the product* — so the
 * film has exactly one moving part. A URL line is edited on screen and the
 * blobatar above it is whatever that URL returns. Nothing else animates, there
 * are no cuts, and the frame never moves.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest, and both are load-bearing rather than decorative:
 *
 * 1. **The blobatar is rendered from the URL, by the endpoint's own parser.**
 *    `render` below runs `parseName`/`parseOptions` out of `apps/api` and hands
 *    the result to `blobatar()`. The markup on screen is byte-for-byte the
 *    response body, so a frame cannot show a face the URL does not produce —
 *    including the ones nobody would think to fake, like `?s=2` clamping up to
 *    8 rather than erroring.
 *
 * 2. **The blobatar is static.** The endpoint serves a bare SVG: no stylesheet
 *    travels with it, and `blobatar()` returns static markup regardless of
 *    `animate` (see `render.ts`). So this film imports neither `motion.css` nor
 *    `seek.css`, and there is no clock to seek — which is the difference
 *    between it and the other two compositions, and the truth about what the
 *    URL gives you. Motion is the library's, and the card says so.
