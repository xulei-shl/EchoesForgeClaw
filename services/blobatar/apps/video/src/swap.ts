/**
 * The adapters film: the line it edits, the clock, and the number on screen.
 *
 * The tweet makes one claim — *the Vue adapter is the React adapter* — and the
 * film has one moving part to match. A single import specifier is edited from
 * `@blobatar/react` to `@blobatar/vue`, and the blobatar above it does not change,
 * because it cannot: the two adapters resolve to the same markup.
 *
 * What makes this a film rather than an assertion is that the creature is not a
 * picture of the claim, it *is* the claim. Remotion is React, so the cheap cut
 * renders `@blobatar/react` throughout and merely writes the other name in the
 * code pane — parity asserted by a film demonstrating one adapter twice. This
 * one mounts a real Vue app (see `VueMount.tsx`) and hands the frame to it the
 * instant the specifier commits. Both are on screen the whole time, stacked and
 * pinned; the edit only decides which is opaque. The swap is invisible because
 * the output is identical, which is the entire point and the only reason a shot
 * of nothing happening is worth eight seconds.
 *
 * The third element is a byte count that never moves. It is measured, not
 * written: `scripts/check-adapters.ts` server-renders both adapters and refuses
 * the build if `BYTES` is not what they actually produce.

/**
 * The blobatar's markup, in bytes, as either adapter renders it.
 *
 * Normalized first, and the normalization is the honest part. Raw SSR output is
 * *not* byte-identical: Vue emits `<!---->` anchors where a child is null and a
 * trailing `;` on the serialized style attribute, so the two differ by 15 bytes
 * before anything is compared. Those are renderer artefacts, not blobatar — the
 * anchors are deliberately wanted, since they hold the root `<g>` at a fixed
 * index whether or not a `<title>` is present — and `test/adapters.test.ts`
 * normalizes exactly those three and nothing else.
 *
 * So the number on screen is the size of the blobatar the two agree on, and the
 * caption says "of svg" rather than "of output" for that reason.
