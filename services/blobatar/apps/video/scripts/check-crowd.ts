/**
 * Two things the crowd shot depends on that are easy to break by editing a list
 * of names, and impossible to spot in a still.
 *
 * 1. The hero has to stay recognisable. The camera comes down onto it out of
 *    120 creatures, and if the blobatar beside it is the same silhouette in
 *    nearly the same hue, the push-in reads as "some blue one" rather than as
 *    the creature the film opened on. Neighbours are checked, not the whole
 *    grid — a twin six cells away is a nice coincidence, a twin adjacent is a
 *    continuity error.
 *
 * 2. The list has to fill the grid exactly. One name too few and `crowd()`
 *    wraps, putting the same blobatar on screen twice, which in a shot whose
 *    entire claim is "every name gets its own" is the worst possible bug.
