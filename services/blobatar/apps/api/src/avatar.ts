const USAGE = `blobatar — deterministic avatars over HTTP

  GET /avatar/<name>

A name is anything that stands for somebody: a username, an email, an id,
a Gravatar hash. The same name always renders the same blobatar.

Parameters (all optional, named as the library names them):

  size, s     8-1024, clamped rather than rejected
  background  none | square | circle | squircle
  hue         0-360 degrees, locks colour so the name drives shape only
  tone        0-1 position in the swatch set, pale to ink; 1 is the top
              edge and renders as 0, so ink is 0.999
  expression  idle | happy | sad | mad | surprised | wink | sleepy
              | smug | unsure | scared | love | shy | sick | thinking
  title       accessible name, 128 characters or fewer
  gen         1 | 2 — which shape vocabulary to render under, see below

Examples:

  /avatar/alain00
  /avatar/alain%40example.com?size=64
  /avatar/team-rocket?background=squircle&expression=smug

Pinning a generation
--------------------
A generation is one frozen name-to-blobatar mapping. Adding a shape is not
additive — a new silhouette has to take its share from the existing ones —
so new shapes arrive as a new generation rather than as a change to yours.

  /avatar/alain00?gen=1     round organic boxy nub cloud sun
  /avatar/alain00?gen=2     …and capsule triangle hexagon droplet

An unversioned URL follows the current major and now renders gen 2. Existing
URLs that must retain their old shapes should pin ?gen=1 before upgrading.

A generation that has appeared in a URL keeps answering. The list only ever
grows — a pinned generation is never retired, redirected to a newer
vocabulary, or answered with a placeholder. That is also why a pinned URL is
served with a year-long immutable cache rather than a day: it cannot come
back different, so every cache between here and your reader is free to keep
it.

Replacing Gravatar
------------------
Swap the host and keep the rest of the URL:

  https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/<hash>?s=200&d=identicon
  https://blobatar.dev/avatar/<hash>?s=200&d=identicon

d, f and r are accepted and ignored — every string renders, so there is
no missing avatar to fall back to and nothing above a G rating to filter.
Code using d=404 to detect "this user has no Gravatar" now gets a 200.

The hash is used as the name. Gravatar's digest is one-way, so the email
cannot be recovered — but the digest is itself derived from the email, so
each person still gets one stable distinct blobatar. It will not be the
same one /avatar/<email> gives: pick one scheme per application.

To keep real Gravatars and use blobatar only for people without one, pass
this endpoint as Gravatar's own fallback instead:

  https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/<hash>?d=<url-encoded blobatar url>

Names are NFC-normalized, trimmed and lowercased before hashing, so
/avatar/Alain and /avatar/alain render the same blobatar from different
URLs. Prefer one spelling: each is cached separately by every cache in
the path.
