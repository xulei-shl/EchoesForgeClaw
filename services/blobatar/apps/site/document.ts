 * comment explaining why it had to be duplicated. Four facts differed. Those
 * four live in the manifest now and the rest lives here, once.
 *
 * Generated rather than checked in, and written before anything reads for them,
 * exactly as `favicon.ts` and `llms.ts` already do — both the build and the dev
 * server call all three at start-up, so a fresh clone has no missing-file step.

 * ~188 KB of font buried in the stylesheet, render-blocking and re-fetched on
 * any class change. Marking them external fixes `bun build` but the dev server
 * takes no such option, so the two environments disagreed. An inline `<style>`
 * is left alone by both, and the files are served straight from `/fonts` in dev
 * and copied there at build time.
 *
 * The preload tags for these two faces are injected by `build.ts` rather than
 * written here, and for a related reason: the bundler resolves and hashes any
 * font URL it finds in an HTML file, so a preload written here would come out
 * pointing at `geist-variable-a1b2c3.woff2` while these rules still ask for the
 * unhashed path — two downloads of the same font, strictly worse than none.
