/**
 * `/llms.txt` — the API, in prose, at a fixed URL.
 *
 * The landing page is a client-rendered SPA: fetch it and you get an empty
 * `<div id="root">` and a script tag. Every claim the site makes about this
 * library is assembled in the browser, so for anything that reads HTML without
 * executing it — an LLM fetching a URL, a link unfurler, a crawler on a budget
 * — this file is the only description of blobatar at the domain.
 *
 * Derived from the package README rather than written beside it, because a
 * second hand-maintained description of the same API is a second thing to get
 * wrong. There is no editorial layer here: what ships is what the README says,
 * minus the parts a consumer cannot act on.
