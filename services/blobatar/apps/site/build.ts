 * files. Both compile cleanly and look fine until you check the number: either
 * mistake takes the stylesheet past 200 KB.
 *
 * The ceiling was 40 KB when one page compiled to ~25 KB. Two pages share one
 * stylesheet — Tailwind's scan is over the whole app, not per entrypoint — and
 * the editor's controls took it to ~39 KB, which left the gate firing on the
 * next ordinary change rather than on the failure it exists for. Raised with
 * that headroom restored; the failure mode it catches is five times this.
 *
 * Raised again, to 60 KB, when the wall replaced the second section: a canvas,
 * a docked panel, an expression strip and their responsive variants took it to
 * ~51 KB. Checked rather than assumed before moving it — no `base64` in the
 * output, no surviving at-rules, 779 rules, and 9.8 KB over the wire gzipped,
 * which is the number that actually reaches anybody. The scan is doing its job;

 * JavaScript had arrived. Lighthouse's network simulation puts *any* script
 * that starts fetching before the first paint onto the critical path, so the
 * bundle's download time was the first paint, whatever else the page did.
 *
 * Three rewrites, worth roughly +2, +1 and +3 points, and each was measured on
 * its own before being kept:
 *
 *   1. prerender  — put real markup in the document instead of an empty root
 *   2. inline CSS — one round trip instead of two
 *   3. defer JS   — take the bundle off the pre-paint critical path
 *
 * The full-page prerender was tried and is *not* what this does: prerendering
 * the wall as well took the document from 1.6 KB to 28 KB and scored 93, worse
 * than doing nothing. `Wall` renders its field only after mount, so what lands
 * in the landing page is the hero, the chat, the closing section and the wall's
 * heading — every word on the page, and none of its sixty SVGs.
 *
 * Two of the three are page-level judgements rather than facts about the build,
 * which is why they are parameters rather than done unconditionally — and why
 * they are stated per page in `manifest.ts`, next to the reasoning for each,
 * rather than here. The editor takes the stylesheet inline and neither of the
 * others; a page added tomorrow says which it wants in one field each.

   *
   *    Worth doing because both faces are above the fold and the code snippet —
   *    set in the mono face — is the LCP element, so the font is on the critical
   *    path by definition. Without a preload the browser only discovers it after
