/**
 * Renders `tree` into `#root`, hydrating if there is already markup there.
 *
 * The check is for markup rather than for a build flag or a manifest field,
 * because that is the thing that actually differs. `build.ts` prerenders the
 * pages whose manifest entry asks for it, so in production their markup is
 * already present and hydrating adopts it. The dev server has no prerender step
 * — it hands the document over as generated, with an empty root — and hydrating
 * that logs "server rendered HTML didn't match" on every reload. React recovers
 * by rendering client-side anyway, which is the right result reached by way of
 * an error message, and an error you are trained to ignore is worse than no
 * error at all.
 *
 * A page that is never prerendered takes the same branch for free.
