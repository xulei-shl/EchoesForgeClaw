 * bundle here carries a slider, twenty controls and a live layout readback,
 * none of which the landing page has any use for, and that page's first paint
 * is already the thing its whole build is tuned around.
 *
 * **The snippet is the deliverable.** The tuned blobatar is the demonstration;
 * the code underneath is what you leave with, and every trade between the two
 * goes to the code. That is why the readouts are raw trait positions rather
 * than friendly units, why the name is emitted literally, and why pinning —
 * the thing that decides what appears in the snippet — is the only piece of
 * interaction state on the page.
 *
 * One state shape carries all of it: `pinned` is simultaneously the UI's notion
 * of which axes you have taken control of, the `traits` map handed to the
 * library, and the object literal in the generated code. They cannot drift,
 * because they are the same object.

        screen rather than being clipped by a preview sized off the width.

        Two elements rather than one with a variable `animate`, and the union in
        `BlobatarProps` is why: a static blobatar is an `<img>` and an animated
        one is inline SVG, so `alt` and `onLoad` stop meaning anything the
        moment motion is on. The library types that as a discriminated union
        precisely so this is a compile error rather than a dead prop.
