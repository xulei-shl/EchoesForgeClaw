/**
 * A single-value slider, in shadcn's idiom over Radix — the same trade the
 * segmented control makes, and for the same reason: keyboard stepping, page-up
 * and -down, RTL, pointer capture and touch are the component, and the visible
 * part is three divs.
 *
 * One addition upstream has no notion of: `ghost`, a second mark on the track
 * at the position the layout *resolved* to. Every other control on this page
 * states what it asked for; the two the eye-cluster fit can pull back have to
 * be able to state what they got. See `editor/resolved.ts`.
