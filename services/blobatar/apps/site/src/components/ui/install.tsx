 * target should be the thing they are looking at rather than a 16px square
 * beside it. The icon stays as the affordance that says this is takeable.
 *
 * The `$` is inside the button but outside the copied text: it is what marks
 * the line as a shell command, and it is also the one character that breaks
 * the paste if it comes along.
