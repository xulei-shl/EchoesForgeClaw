/**
 * Overlapping avatars with an overflow count — shadcn's AvatarGroup, except the
 * fallback problem it exists to solve does not exist here. There is no image to
 * fail and no initials to fall back to: a blobatar is the fallback, which is
 * why this is twenty lines rather than a component per layer.
 *
 * `background="circle"` and the ring are one decision. Blobatars are
 * transparent-backdrop silhouettes, so overlapping them directly merges two
 * blobs into one shape; a solid disc separated from the disc behind it by a
 * ring in the surface colour is what makes the stack read as a stack. That ring
 * is also why the card this sits in is a solid `bg-raised` — against the
 * translucent default the rings would be a shade off the panel behind them.
