/**
 * The two categorical axes.
 *
 * Both are read by the layout as *bands* rather than as numbers — `shapeOf`
 * splits [0, 1) into the package's silhouettes, `toneAt` into six swatches —
 * so a slider would be a control with invisible detents. A picker states the
 * bands, and pinning one writes its midpoint.
 *
 * Neither is a `<select>`, and for the reason the hero's shape row gives: "nub"
 * and "pale neutral" are words for things nobody has seen yet. Both rows show
 * the thing.
 *
 * Both are also *sets* rather than choices, which follows from the same
 * property that makes them pickers at all: a row with a table behind it can
 * offer positions to point at, and pointing at three of them is narrowing. An
 * axis without one — hue, and every slider here — can still be narrowed by the
 * library, but not by a control that has nothing to enumerate.

/**
 * The silhouette row.
 *
 * One tile fixes the silhouette; several narrow it and leave the name to choose
 * among them, which is the thing a single position could not say — see
 * `TraitOverrides` in the library. So the tiles toggle rather than select, and
 * `auto` is the empty set instead of an eleventh option beside the ten.
 *
 * `auto` is *not* the same as selecting all ten, which is worth knowing before
 * someone tries it: ten selected is an even spread over the roster, while
 * `auto` is the library's own bands, and those are deliberately unequal — a
 * round blobatar is common and a triangle is rare. Both are reasonable things
 * to want and only one of them is the default.
