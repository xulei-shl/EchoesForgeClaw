              Below the question, because that is the order it happens in: you are
              asked, you answer, the face is what comes back. With the blobatar above
              the input the page showed you the answer before it had asked, which
              is what made the column read as three unrelated things stacked.

              `animate="always"` puts this on the inline-SVG path — roughly a dozen
              DOM nodes instead of one <img>. That is the trade the library
              documents, and a single hero blobatar is exactly the case it is meant
              for.

              A real button, not a click handler on the SVG. The blobatar keeps its
              own `role="img"` and name — the expression is decorative and
              deliberately invisible to assistive tech — so the button is what
              carries the action, and its label describes what clicking *does*
              rather than what the face is currently doing.

              It is also the popover's anchor. A panel that positions itself off
              the little icon has to open *somewhere* relative to a point inside
              the sentence, and every direction from there crosses the blobatar at
              one width or another — which is fatal for a control surface whose
              whole job is changing what the blobatar looks like. Anchored to the
              face instead, "beside it" and "under it" are directions that mean
              what they say.

          hero and two of wall — which put the page's only call to action behind
          the entire page.

          `self-start` is load-bearing on both: a flex column stretches its
          children, and a command pill as wide as the snippet stops reading as a
          thing you press.

          The strip sits above the command rather than beside it, and lighter
          than it: it picks which of four commands you are being shown, so it
          has to be read first and weigh less than the thing it labels.
