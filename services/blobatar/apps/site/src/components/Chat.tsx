 * The thread, flat and in order. Grouping consecutive messages from one person
 * is done at render time rather than stored as nested runs, because the
 * grouping is a presentation rule — a chat that inserts a message in the middle
 * regroups on its own, and data shaped as runs would have to be rebuilt.
 *
 * The four handles are chosen, not arbitrary: teal, orange, green and purple
 * out of the hash. A section whose claim is "you can tell these people apart"
 * cannot open with two seeds that both landed on pale blue — that is the one
 * draw of four this page is not entitled to.
