 * D1, as `bun:sqlite`.

 * Two callers, and they want it for the same reason. The tests want it because
 * a mock cannot fail the way this feature depends on failing: every rule the
 * wall has — one cell to one person, one blob per address per day — is a
 * uniqueness constraint rather than a check in application code, so a suite
 * that stubs the database out asserts the happy path and nothing else. The dev
 * server wants it because `bun run site` is a `Bun.serve`, not a Worker, and
 * without this the wall's endpoints simply are not there — the landing page
 * spends development looking like a wall nobody has ever written to.
 *
 * Both get the real SQL over the real migrations against the engine D1 is. What
 * neither gets is the network: no latency, no subrequest limits, and `batch` is
 * a local transaction rather than a remote one. `wrangler dev` is still the
 * thing to reach for when the question is about Cloudflare rather than about
 * the wall.

 * table is deliberately not the one wrangler uses: this is a local scratch
 * database, and pretending its bookkeeping is wrangler's would invite somebody
