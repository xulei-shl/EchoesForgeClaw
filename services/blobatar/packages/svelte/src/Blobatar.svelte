  `@blobatar/svelte` — the Svelte adapter.

  A real Svelte component rather than a JavaScript one that builds DOM by hand,
  which is what ADR-0009 split the packages to make possible: the transform this
  file needs is the Svelte compiler itself, and no `Bun.build` call can hold it
  beside React's transform and Preact's runtime.

  It is also the reason this package ships source instead of a `dist` — see
  ADR-0010. The compiler that turns this into renderable code belongs to the
  consumer, not to this repo.

    `role` and `aria-hidden` below are one decision written as two attributes.
    With a `title` the markup carries a `<title>`, so this is a labelled image;
    without one it is decoration and should be skipped entirely — the same call
    `alt=""` makes on the `<img>` path. Never both: a `role="img"` that is also
    `aria-hidden` just contradicts itself. Svelte omits an attribute whose value
    is `undefined`, so the pair needs no conditional spread — and must not use
    one: a spread here silently swallows a `role` the caller passed in `rest`.

      Three real children rather than one `{@html}` blob, and the reason is the
      morph. Only the third varies at runtime — its class does, when the
      expression changes — and `{@html}` is all-or-nothing: had the root `<g>`
      stayed inside that string, every expression change would replace the whole
      subtree. A fresh element has no previous computed value, so no transition
      runs on it and every idle animation under it restarts from phase zero.

      The first two are siblings of the root rather than inside it: `<title>`
      names the element it is the first child of, so nesting it would label a
      `<g>` instead of this `<svg>`, and the backdrop must sit outside the
      hover-lift or the plate scales with the creature.
