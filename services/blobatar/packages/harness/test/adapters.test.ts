/**
 * The adapters must agree.
 *
 * Imported by package name, not by relative path into `blobatar/src`. That is
 * the difference this file gained when it moved out of the library: it now
 * resolves each adapter through its own published `exports` map and its built
 * `dist`, so a broken export path or a build that drops the component fails
 * here rather than in a consumer's install. Nothing in this package aliases
 * `blobatar/*` back to source, deliberately — see `tsconfig.json`.
 *
 * An adapter owns the outer element and nothing else — it adds no geometry and
 * no defaults of its own — so two adapters handed the same name and the same
 * options have to produce the same blobatar. That is the whole contract, and
 * it is not self-enforcing: Vue's runtime props table can inject values the
 * caller never passed (a type list containing `Boolean` casts an omitted prop
 * to `false`), which is a way for an adapter to change the picture while
 * looking like it only re-expresses it.
 *
 * These compare rendered output rather than the options objects, because the
 * options object is exactly the thing a props table can quietly rewrite.

/**
 * Three differences between the two SSR renderers that are not differences in
 * the blobatar, normalized away so a real one cannot hide behind them:
 *
 * - Quote escaping. React writes `&#x27;`, Vue writes `&#39;`; neither survives
 *   the parse.
 * - A trailing `;` on Vue's serialized style attribute.
 * - `<!---->` placeholders where a child is `null`. These are Vue's anchors for
 *   an unkeyed children list, and they are wanted: they hold the root `<g>` at
 *   a fixed index whether or not a `<title>` is present, so toggling `title`
 *   patches in place instead of shifting every sibling up one and rebuilding
 *   the subtree the morph lives in.
