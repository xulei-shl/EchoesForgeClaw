 * `tsconfig.json`'s `jsxImportSource` selects and `scripts/build.ts` keeps
 * external. That is the build isolation ADR-0009 split the packages for: core's
 * single `Bun.build` could not hold Preact's runtime beside React's transform,
 * and the attempt that tried gave up and returned a raw DOM node from a
 * function component — which Preact drops silently for an empty string, with a
 * clean typecheck and a green suite.
 *
 * `packages/harness` renders this package with `preact-render-to-string` for
 * exactly that reason. An adapter is only known to work when something has
 * watched it produce markup.

          Three real children rather than one innerHTML blob, and the reason is
          the morph. Only the third varies at runtime — its class does, when the
          expression changes — and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is all-or-nothing:
          had the root `<g>` stayed inside that string, every expression change
          would replace the entire subtree. A fresh element has no previous
          computed value, so no transition runs on it and every idle animation
          under it restarts from phase zero.

          The first two have to be siblings of the root rather than inside it:
          `<title>` names the element it is the first child of, so nesting it
          would label a `<g>` instead of this `<svg>`, and the backdrop must sit
          outside the hover-lift or the plate scales with the creature.
