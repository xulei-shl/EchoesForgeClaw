# blobatar

Deterministic geometric blobatars from any string. No dependencies, ~4.4 KB gzipped.

```ts
import { blobatar } from "blobatar";

blobatar("alain@example.com"); // => '<svg xmlns="..." viewBox="0 0 100 100">…'
```

```sh
bun add blobatar @blobatar/react
```

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/react";

<Blobatar name={user.email} size={48} />;
```

```html
<script setup>
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/vue";
</script>

<template>
  <Blobatar name="alain@example.com" :size="48" />
</template>
```

```sh
npx shadcn@latest registry add @blobatar=https://blobatar.dev/r/{name}.json
npx shadcn@latest add @blobatar/avatar
```

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@/components/ui/blobatar";

<Blobatar name={user.email} src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

The shadcn item is a composition rather than a copy of the generator: it wraps
shadcn's `Avatar`, takes a `src` alongside the `name`, and falls back to a
blobatar when there is no profile image. What it installs into your project is
that wrapper, which you own; the generator stays in `blobatar` and
`@blobatar/react` as ordinary dependencies, so it keeps rendering what this
version of this package renders.

A blobatar always stands for somebody — a user, a bot, a team, a repo — so the
value it is generated from is that somebody's `name`: a username, a display
name, an email, a handle, an id. Any string works and the same string always
renders the same blobatar.

```ts
import { blobatarUri } from "blobatar/uri";

el.style.backgroundImage = `url("${blobatarUri(user.id)}")`;
```

## Shapes

A soft body and two capsule eyes, drawn from ten silhouettes: `round`,
`organic`, `boxy`, `nub`, `cloud`, `sun`, `capsule`, `triangle`, `hexagon` and
`droplet`. They are weighted so rounds and pebbles are everyday and the louder
shapes remain a find. Transparent backdrop by default; the body is the blobatar.

The main entry also carries the palette and trait utilities. If all you do is
render, import the renderer on its own and save about a kilobyte:

```ts
import { blobatar } from "blobatar/blob";
```

## What it guarantees

**Determinism.** The same name always renders the same blobatar within a major
version. Numeric ranges, the shape thresholds, the tone set and the expression
roster are all part of that contract, and it is enforced rather than intended:
`test/golden/gen2.txt` records 1312 renders and a shape histogram over 20,000
seeds, so moving any of them fails the build.

**Stability across versions.** Traits are addressed by string key rather than
drawn from a sequential stream, so adding a trait in a later minor cannot
disturb existing blobatars. Adding a shape or a tone _would_ — those move
together, as a **generation**.

Adding a silhouette is not additive: the shape thresholds partition [0, 1), so
a new one has to take its share from the existing ones and every name in the
moved region gets a different creature. New shapes therefore arrive only in a
new package major. Upgrading `blobatar@1` → `@2` is the opt-in; applications that
stay on v1 keep both its output and package size. A major contains one frozen
generation, so the ordinary API remains just `blobatar(name, options)`.

**Contrast.** Eyes clear 4.5:1 against the body at every hue and every tone —
verified at 1° resolution in the test suite. Polarity flips automatically, so
the near-black tone gets light eyes rather than an invisible face.
Colors passed via the `palette` option bypass all of this, by definition.

**Name normalization.** Names are NFC-normalized, trimmed and lowercased before
hashing, so `Alain@Example.com` and `alain@example.com` agree, as do the
precomposed and decomposed spellings of `café`. Pass `normalize: false` to hash
the raw string. Hashing runs over UTF-8 bytes, so non-ASCII and astral-plane
names (`日本語`, `🦊`) behave consistently across engines.

**No element ids.** Nothing uses `<defs>`, gradients or filters, so rendering
several hundred blobatars on one page cannot produce id collisions.

## Options

| Option       | Default     | Notes                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`       | —           | Emits `width`/`height`. Omit to let CSS size it.                        |
| `background` | none        | `"squircle"`, `"circle"`, `"square"`, or `false`.                       |
| `hue`        | —           | Locks hue in degrees; the name then drives shape only.                 |
| `tone`       | —           | Locks the swatch as a 0–1 position in the set, pale to ink. `1` sits on the top edge and renders as `0`; use `0.999` for ink. |
| `traits`     | —           | Pins individual traits as 0–1 positions, or a list to choose among. See below. |
| `palette`    | —           | Per-key hex overrides. Bypasses the contrast guarantee.                 |
| `normalize`  | `true`      | NFC + trim + lowercase.                                                 |
| `contrast`   | `true`      | Enforce the contrast floors.                                            |
| `title`      | —           | Adds a `<title>` for screen readers.                                    |
| `animate`    | —           | `"hover"` or `"always"`. See below — it changes how the blobatar renders. |
| `expression` | `idle`      | One of fourteen poses, imported as a value. See below.                  |

## Configuring

Every axis of a blobatar is a named trait, and `traits` pins any of them. Values
are the 0–1 position the hash would otherwise have produced, so they are read in
the same units, through the same ranges, as a hashed one:

```ts
// Always a sun with wide eyes — colour and everything else still per name.
blobatar(user.email, { traits: { shape: 0.95, "eye.ratio": 0 } });
```

Keys you leave out still come from the name. That is the useful middle ground:
lock the two things that carry your brand, and every user still gets their own
creature.

A **list** narrows a key without fixing it — the name still chooses, but only
from what you named:

```ts
// Round, cloud or sun, never the other seven. Which one is still per name.
blobatar(user.email, { traits: { shape: [0.11, 0.825, 0.965] } });
```

The choice is per name, stable, and spread evenly over the values you list. An
empty list is the same as leaving the key out.

Pin everything and the name stops mattering, which is how you build one fixed
blobatar — pass any constant string alongside a full map.

Nothing is bypassed. The layout runs in full, so an eye cluster too large for
its body is scaled to fit exactly as a hashed one would be, and no combination
of values can put an eye outside the body or geometry outside the frame — the
test suite sweeps the corners of the space to prove it. The flip side is that an
extreme value can land short of where you asked; `_layout()` reports what it
actually resolved to.

`hue` and `tone` state two of these traits in friendlier units — degrees and a
swatch position — and take precedence over `traits.hue` and `traits.tone`.

Trait keys are stable across minors, like the traits themselves. The ranges they
are read into are what a stated position is relative to, so those are frozen per
major alongside the shape thresholds and the tone set.

Trait names are not enumerated here on purpose: they follow the layout. Read the
shared ones off `styles/compose.ts` and the per-silhouette ones off
`styles/shapes.ts`, or let the editor write the map for you.

## Animation

Off by default. When on, the blobatar idles: a soft breathe, a bob, a blink, and
the occasional glance to one side. Every timing and direction is drawn from the
name, so a grid reads as a crowd rather than a drill team.

```tsx
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/react";
import "blobatar/motion.css"; // required — nothing animates without it

<Blobatar name={user.email} animate="hover" size={48} />;
```

```html
<script setup>
import { Blobatar } from "@blobatar/vue";
import "blobatar/motion.css"; // required — nothing animates without it
</script>

<template>
  <Blobatar name="alain@example.com" animate="hover" :size="48" />
</template>
```

**Turning this on changes the rendering mode, and that is not free.** A static
blobatar is a single `<img>`; an animated one is inline SVG, roughly a dozen DOM
nodes. Content inside an `<img>` is an isolated document that `:hover` cannot
reach and host-page CSS cannot style, so there is no way to have both. A list of
400 blobatars is exactly the case the `<img>` default was chosen for.

`"hover"` animates one blobatar at a time — the right default for a grid, where
continuous ambient motion is both visual noise and 400 live animations.
`"always"` is for the single-blobatar case: a profile header, an onboarding
screen.

Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by going fully static, and does not
trigger on touch, where a tap would otherwise latch hover on.

The glance is a large-size effect — at 40px it moves the eyes about half a
pixel. It is worth the most on a profile header, which is what `"always"` is
for. Eyes may cross outside the body outline on a hard glance; that is intended,
and reads as a face turning rather than as a bug.

Currently `@blobatar/react` and `@blobatar/vue` only. The string API still returns static markup:
supporting `animate` there means every consumer of `blobatar()` carries the motion
code whether they animate or not, which is a real cost for a feature most
callers will never use. If you need animated markup without either framework,
open an issue — it wants its own entry point rather than a branch inside
`blobatar()`.

## Expressions

A pose the blobatar holds until you change it. Setting one morphs from whatever
it was wearing.

| pose        | reads as                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `idle`      | the default — byte-identical to passing nothing              |
| `happy`     | tall arcs, lifted, tilted in parallel                        |
| `sad`       | small eyes dropped low, brows in                             |
| `mad`       | wide flat bars in a `\ /`, warm-tinted, trembling            |
| `surprised` | the only pose that grows the eyes — wide and lifted          |
| `wink`      | one eye shut, the other open                                 |
| `sleepy`    | level lids low over a sunk body                              |
| `smug`      | narrow and cocked — a head tilt, not a brow                  |
| `unsure`    | one eye squeezed, the pair barely moved                      |
| `scared`    | small, converged, shivering                                  |
| `love`      | narrow and drawn together, rose-tinted                       |
| `shy`       | small, low, converged, pale blush                            |
| `sick`      | wide bars slumped into a `/ \`, green-tinted, faint tremor   |
| `thinking`  | eyes at two heights, trading places — a loader with a face   |

Expressions are **imported as values, not named as strings**, so you ship the
ones you use and nothing else:

```tsx
import { happy, idle } from "blobatar/expression";

<Blobatar name={user.email} animate="always" expression={happy} size={64} />;
```

`thinking` is the one pose that keeps moving. It holds a staggered pair of eyes
and, with `blobatar/motion.css` loaded, seesaws them on a 900ms cycle — the
two-dot loader, drawn with the two dots a blobatar already has. Set it while you
are fetching and clear it when you are done; like every other pose it is a state
you hold, not an animation you fire. Without the stylesheet, or under
`prefers-reduced-motion`, it holds one frame of that swing, which still reads as
a creature with its attention somewhere else. Whatever it is waiting on still
needs to be announced somewhere real in your DOM — the face is decoration.

The same values work with `@blobatar/vue`; only the import of the component
itself changes.

The first expression you import costs about 340 bytes (the shared serializer and
bake, paid once) and each untinted one after it about 35. The four tinted poses —
`mad`, `love`, `shy`, `sick` — are the exception: the first of them pulls in the
OKLab colour path for about 720 bytes, and each tinted one after that costs about
60, because they share one walk with four targets. The whole roster is about 1.5
KB over `blob` alone; a consumer who imports none carries no pose code at all,
which is why `expression` is a value rather than a string.

**A state, not an event.** Nothing returns to `idle` on its own and there are no
timers. If you want a burst, schedule the clear yourself:

```ts
setMood(happy);
setTimeout(() => setMood(idle), 1200);
```

**Independent of `animate`, in both directions.** Without `animate` you get the
pose statically, which is why this works in the string API and under
`prefers-reduced-motion`. The _morph_ needs `animate`, because that is what puts
the blobatar in inline SVG where CSS can reach it. Setting `expression` never
turns `animate` on for you — that would silently flip a 400-blobatar grid from 400
`<img>` tags to 400 SVG trees.

```ts
blobatar(name, { expression: happy }); // static, posed, no morph
```

`idle` renders byte-identical markup to omitting the option, so adding this
moved no existing blobatar.

The pose moves parts the blobatar already has — eye scale, tilt, offset, a rigid
body shift, a tremor and a tint — and never adds a mark, so a blob grows no mouth
when it is happy. That ceiling is real and worth knowing before you reach for it.
`happy`, `surprised` and `wink` read unmistakably, because a shape nothing else
in the roster wears is doing the work. The rest read as clearly different from
idle and from each other, without announcing the emotion the way a mouth would:
`sick` is not going to read as nausea on its own, but you will never mistake it
for `sleepy`. Two capsules and a soft body only go so far, and every pose here is
separated from its nearest neighbour by three channels rather than one — never by
its tint alone, so the roster still works in greyscale. See
[docs/expression-spec.md](./docs/expression-spec.md) for what carries signal and
what does not.

Expressions are decorative and do not reach assistive technology: `title` names
who the blobatar is and does not change with the pose. Under reduced motion the
pose is adopted instantly at full strength — the morph is removed, the
expression is not.

## How it works

**One primitive carries the symmetric shapes** — the superellipse
`|x/a|^n + |y/b|^n = 1`. `n=2` is an ellipse, `n≈4` a squircle, `n≈5` a rounded
bar. Each quadrant is one cubic Bézier whose control offset is solved so the
curve passes exactly through the 45° point; at `n=2` that yields 0.5523, the
standard circle constant. Four segments keeps a part at ~130 bytes of path data.

**A closed Catmull-Rom spline carries the organic ones.** Radii sampled around a
circle and joined into a loop, so a hash perturbing them by ±16% produces
lopsided pebbles with no noise function. Catmull-Rom interpolates its points
exactly, which is what makes the radii mean what they say and keeps containment
predictable.

**Overlapping fills replace boolean geometry.** Clouds, suns and nubs are just
extra circles drawn in the same `<g fill>` behind the core. They union visually
for free — no path arithmetic, no clip paths, no element ids.

**Eye dimensions are fractions of the body radius**, not absolute units. Bodies
range from 22 to 38 units depending on how much room the decoration needs, and
absolute sizes would drift off a small sun while looking lost on a large round.

Colors are resolved from OKLCh to hex at render time rather than emitted as
`oklch()`, because server-side rasterizers largely do not support it and blobatars
get rasterized server-side constantly.

Whole blobatars land at 590–1060 bytes of markup.

## Development

Run these from the repo root — this package lives in a Bun workspace alongside
`apps/site` (the landing page) and `apps/demo` (the tuning grid).

```sh
bun dev        # tuning grid at localhost:3001
bun site       # landing page at localhost:3000
bun test       # 94 tests
bun run size   # per-entry gzip budgets
bun run check
```

Both apps depend on `blobatar` as `workspace:*` and import it by its public
entry points, so they resolve through the real `exports` map rather than by
relative path — breaking an export breaks their build. See
[ADR-0001](../../docs/adr/0001-bun-workspaces-without-turborepo.md).

The tuning grid is the real design tool. Numeric ranges can only be judged in
aggregate — you are looking for clusters, dead zones and outliers, which are
invisible when you inspect one name at a time. The shape filter exists because
the rarer silhouettes would otherwise show up a handful of times per page, too
few to tune against.

`test/geometry.test.ts` covers what eyeballing cannot: that no name anywhere in
the space puts an eye off the body, fuses two capsules together, detaches a
petal, or pushes geometry outside the frame.
