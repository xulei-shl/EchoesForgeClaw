/**
 * The trait keys shared by Blobatar 2's silhouette families.
 *
 * Now spread across `styles/compose.ts` (the body and eye ranges every
 * style shares) and `styles/shapes.ts` (the per-silhouette families like
 * `nub.a0` and `cloud.r0`), which is exactly why this stays a hand-written
 * list: the keys a style reads are a property of its band table, and no
 * single module has them all any more.
 *
 * Kept as a list rather than derived, because the point of the tests that use
 * it is to sweep the configuration surface as a *caller* sees it — a list
 * scraped from the implementation would agree with the implementation by
 * construction, including where the implementation is wrong.
