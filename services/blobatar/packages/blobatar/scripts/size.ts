/**
 * Bundle size gate.
 *
 * Measured through synthetic consumers rather than by building the barrel
 * directly — a library entry with no importer tree-shakes to nothing, which
 * reports a flattering number that no real app ever sees.
 *
 * Budgets are per entry point. The core budget is the one that matters: it is
 * what stops a convenience import from quietly pulling in the React adapter, or
 * a palette tweak from doubling the color code.
 *
 * This is the **source gate**, and the name is load-bearing. Every consumer
 * below imports `../../src/*` and none of them ever touches `dist` or resolves
 * an `exports` map, so what is measured here is what the source tree-shakes to —
 * not what the published package costs. The two are not the same number: core's
 * publish build minifies better than a synthetic consumer of its source does,
 * and `react` below reads 5336 against 5204 for the same component reached
 * through `dist`.
 *
 * What ships is the **ship gate**, `packages/harness/scripts/size.ts`, which
 * resolves each package by name. It lives there rather than here because
 * measuring `@blobatar/react` means depending on it, and core cannot — the
 * adapter peer-depends on core, so the devDependency back would make turbo's
 * `^build` graph cyclic.

    // this is the number that catches the option creeping back into the core.
    //
    // Raised again by 30 B — 19 of them spent — when each animated eye started
    // emitting its own `transform-origin`. That is not a feature, it is the
    // price of a Gecko bug: a `<g>`'s `fill-box` follows its children, so a
    // blink moved the eye wrapper's origin and a posed eye travelled ~30 viewBox
    // units every time it blinked. Pinning the origin in the markup is the only
    // place the fix can live, since the value is per eye. Every entry below
    // carries the same 19 B for the same reason. See `.mo-eye` in `motion.css`.
    //
    // Raised from 3700 by 33 B when expressions gained a colour channel. That is
    // the whole of what the core pays for it: one call through `tint` on the
    // expression value, on the static path, next to the `bake` call that was
    // already there. Everything that computes a colour — `hot`, `mixHex`,
    // `fromHex` — is reached only from an expression that tints, and this row
    // proves it is shaken out, because a consumer who imports none still lands
    // here rather than 200 B higher.
    //
    // Raised from 3780 by 20 B for trait overrides, and the number is the whole
    // argument for that design: making *every* axis of the blobatar configurable
    // cost one lookup and an inline clamp on the trait reader, because the
    // layout already addressed its values by key. A prop per knob would have
    // put ~25 named options and their plumbing in this row instead. Measured at
    // 1 B over before the budget bump — the branch gzips against the reader
    // that was already there.
    // Lowered from 3800 when the `character` variant was removed in 0.1.0. The
    // variant itself was never in this row — what came out was the plumbing that
    // existed only to keep two of them apart: the palette's variant-keyed ramp
    // and floor tables, the `expressive` flag, and the `variant` argument
    // threaded through `resolve`.
    // Blobatar 2 binds its ten-shape style directly. The private composer keeps
    // silhouette implementations local without retaining a runtime generation
    // branch or any historical mapping in this graph (ADR-0008).
    // Measured against published v0.2.0's six-shape renderer: 3657 → 4247 B
    // gzip, +590 B (+16.1%). The abandoned runtime-generation version measured
    // 4286 B, so making the package major the seam recovers 39 B as well as the
    // public API complexity.
    // Raised from 4300 by 110 B when the capsule and droplet stopped being
    // approximated. Both drew a union whose parts crossed rather than met — a
    // rounded box behind two cap circles, a soft diamond stabbed into a ball —
    // and both showed the crease. `box` and `taper` in `shape.ts` are what the
    // exactness costs: a stadium needs a run at full height for its caps to meet
    // along their diameters, and a taper has to be the tangents from its apex to
    // the body ellipse. Measured against the arc-drawn single-outline version of
    // the same two shapes, which is a further 108 B for an identical render.

    //
    // Raised from 5650 by 80 B when the animated branch stopped being a single
    // `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and became three children: a `<title>`, the
    // backdrop as a real `<path>`, and the root `<g>` whose class React now

    // Raised again from 5750 by 64 B for the colour channel: the 33 B the core

    // (no serialized dependency string, no memoized `{__html}`).

    name: "motion css",
    // Raised again from 950 for the expression layer: nine `@property`
    // registrations, the pose terms folded into the existing keyframes, and the
    // reduced-motion block restating the pose statically (an expression must
    // survive reduced motion — only the morph is removed). The registrations
    // look like the expensive part and are not; nine near-identical blocks
    // gzip to almost nothing, which is the same effect the wrap chains rely on.
    //
    // Previously raised from 800 for the wrap layer (§4.7), which no smaller form fits:
    // foreshortening alone measured 854, and the two obvious factorings both
    // came out *larger* than writing the chains out (see `@keyframes mo-wrap`).
    // Worth it here and nowhere else — this file is paid once per app, so 180
    // bytes buys the same 3D read that per-blobatar markup could not afford.
    // Raised from 1200 for two corrections rather than features: the shared
    // `transform-box`/`transform-origin` rule that puts the body layers'
    // pivot back at the middle of the frame instead of SVG's default corner,
    // and the lean brackets around every eye scale, which stop a leaned capsule
    // squashing along screen axes. Both are what `scripts/probe-compose.ts`
    // measures; neither is optional.
    //
    // Raised from 1250 for the exaggeration pass, which is a net add of ~130 B
    // after the body-scale and lean channels came out. Three things bought it,
    // and all three are things markup would otherwise have to carry per blobatar:
    //
    //  - Per-eye asymmetry. Three registrations and four derived values on
    //    `.mo-eye`, replacing the only other option — per-eye inline styles,
    //    which are forbidden because nothing in `parts.inner` may vary with the
    //    expression.
    //  - The tremor: one registration and a four-stop keyframe.
    //  - The two `fill` rules, which is how a hot pose reaches a colour that
    //    lives in a presentation attribute CSS cannot read.
    //
    // The transition lists got *shorter* despite three more channels, because
    // the duration and easing lists are now stated once in `--mo-md`/`--mo-me`
    // instead of being restated in full by the `:hover` rule.
    // Raised from 1400 for one rule, and it is the cheapest 7 bytes in the
    // file: pausing the idle loops on touch devices, where the hover rule two
    // lines above it has already pinned `--mo-amp` at zero and the loops can
    // therefore only resolve to the identity pose. Measured on a page with
    // sixty blobatars, it took style and layout in a Lighthouse trace from
    // 6.7s to 1.9s — the loops are ~8 per blobatar and most of them drive
    // registered custom properties, which recalculate on the main thread
    // rather than compositing. A grid that reads as a crowd is the case this
    // library invites, so that is the case worth being cheap in.
    // Raised from 1450 for `thinking`, and this is the raise worth arguing
    // with. Every other entry in this list is paid by the consumer who asked for
    // the feature; this file is paid by everyone who imports the stylesheet, so
    // 95 B here is 95 B on an app that will never render a loading face. It buys
    // the only thing the pose vocabulary could not previously say — a message
    // that is a *duration* rather than a shape — and it buys it for every future
    // pose that wants one, since `--mo-rock` is an amplitude and not a switch.
    // Three parts, in descending order of cost:
    //
    //  - The seesaw itself: two registrations, a two-stop keyframe and the
    //    `--mo-ph` blend on `.mo-eye` that makes a symmetric swing and a
    //    one-sided differential the same term. The blend is what removes the
    //    corrective arithmetic from `bakePose`, so it is cheaper than it looks.
    //  - `--mo-edy2`: one registration and one term in an existing `translate`.
    //  - The touch-device exception, ~55 B, which is the price of the loop not
    //    being gated on `--mo-amp` like everything else in the file. Without it
    //    the feature is frozen on every phone.
