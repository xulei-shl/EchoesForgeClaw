/**
 * Publish build.
 *
 * `exports` in package.json points at `dist`, because what goes to npm has to
 * be JS a plain Node resolver and a non-transpiling bundler can both read. This
 * script produces it. (The workspace apps do not wait on it — they alias
 * `blobatar/*` to `src` through tsconfig paths.)
 *
 * Each entry is bundled standalone, so `blob`, the barrel and the adapters each
 * carry a private copy of the renderer. `splitting: true` removes that
 * duplication and was tried; it is off deliberately, because the duplication is
 * on disk and the cost of removing it lands in consumer bundles.
 *
 * Measured by bundling consumers against the published `exports` map, gzipped:
 *
 *                        standalone   splitting
 *   import one entry        4202 B      4213 B   ← the common case, and it loses
 *   import two entries      5068 B      4310 B
 *   `dist` at rest        277755 B    153125 B
 *
 * Splitting is a 45% cut to `dist` and a 26% cut to the install, but it pays for
 * that with import statements in every entry, so the consumer who imports one
 * thing — nearly all of them — ships slightly more. Shipped bytes win over bytes
 * at rest, so the duplication stays.
 *
 * The other reason not to reach for it: on Bun 1.3.14 splitting compiles a
 * barrel whose body is *nothing but* re-exports into a module re-exporting names
 * it never imported, and Node throws `SyntaxError: Export 'C' is not defined in
 * module` on link. `src/index.ts` happens to avoid this because `VERSION` is a
 * real binding — verified by deleting it, building and linking under Node — so
 * turning splitting on silently couples this build to that one line.
 *
 * `scripts/smoke.mjs` is what caught that bug and links the built barrel under
 * Node on every build, so it will catch it again if anyone retries this.
 *
 * Note that `scripts/size.ts` cannot see any of the above — its synthetic
 * consumers import `../../src/*` and never touch `dist`, so its budgets did not
 * move by a single byte when splitting went on. It guards what the source
 * tree-shakes to, not what the package ships. Measure against `dist` if you
 * change the entry layout.
