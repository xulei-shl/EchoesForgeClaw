/**
 * The browser half of `scripts/probe-compose.ts`. Runs in headless Chrome and
 * writes its verdicts into `#r` as JSON.
 *
 * Everything checked here is checked here and nowhere else, because none of it
 * is visible to a test that only reads markup.
 *
 * **A — the two renderings of one pose agree.** The static path bakes the pose
 * into path data; the animated path composes it out of custom properties in
 * CSS. Nothing forced those to match, and they did not: `superellipse` bakes
 * rotation into coordinates, so a scale in CSS was squashing leaned eyes along
 * screen axes while the bake squashed them along the capsule's. This renders
 * both and compares where the pixels land.
 *
 * **B — an expression change does not rebuild the DOM.** The morph is a
 * transition, and a transition needs an element with a previous computed value.
 * If React replaces the subtree, the pose is simply born at its final value and
 * every idle animation under it restarts from phase zero. Checked with real
 * React, because the thing under test is React's reconciliation.
 *
 * **C — the morph is watchable, not merely present.** See `checkPacing`.
 *
 * **D — the tremor.** The one pose channel with no static counterpart, so A
 * cannot see it. See `checkShake`.
 *
 * **E — the two renderings of one colour agree.** A's argument, one axis over.
 * See `checkTint`.
 *
 * **F — the morph runs under a real page's conditions**, with the idle layers
 * live rather than frozen. See `checkLive`.
 *
 * **G — all three directions morph**, not just the way in. See
 * `checkDirections`.
 *
 * **H — a blink does not move a posed eye.** The one defect that lived in a
 * single frame of an ambient loop rather than in the pose. See `checkBlink`.
 *
 * **I — the seesaw.** The second channel A can only see one frame of, and the
 * first that is a *loop the bake agrees with* rather than one it cannot express.
 * See `checkRock`.
 *
 * F and G exist because C's evidence was narrower than it read: it froze the
 * idle layers and only ever went `idle → happy`, which is one of three
 * mechanisms under conditions no real page has. Neither found a defect. That is
 * worth keeping anyway — "the morph doesn't run" was reported twice against a
 * library where it did, and being able to answer that in a minute with a
 * measurement is the point of this file.
 *
 * **Every new pose channel needs a case here.** A channel that only the CSS
 * applies, or only `bakePose` applies, looks completely fine in `bun test` — and
 * a channel with no static counterpart at all, like the tremor, is invisible to
 * every check that compares the two paths.

 * wrong as the *only* evidence the curve runs: a live blobatar has five idle
 * animations going, and two of them — `mo-blink` and `mo-wrap` — write the very
 * properties the pose composes into. "It interpolates when nothing else is
 * touching it" is a weaker claim than it sounds.
 *
 * Instrumented on the registered custom property rather than on geometry,
 * which is what makes this measurable at all with the idle layers live: blink
 * closes the eye to 8% of its height for ~100ms at a time, so a geometric sample
 * cannot tell a morph from a blink. `--mo-esy` is a `<number>` nothing but the
 * transition writes.
 *
 * Mirrors the site's hero exactly — `animate="always"`, a `title`, a CSS-sized

 * Gecko recomputes it as the shape inside shrinks. Every blink therefore moved
 * the wrapper's origin, the pose's anisotropic scale multiplied that shift, and
 * the eye travelled ~30 viewBox units out and back — on `mad`, out of the frame
 * entirely. Reported as "the transition back to idle blinks", because an idle
 * wrapper's transform is the identity and an identity does not care where its
 * origin is: the artifact existed only while an expression was on.
 *
 * Nothing else here could see it. A and E compare the two renderings *at rest*,
 * and at rest the pose is correct in both engines; C, F and G sample the morph's
 * own channels, which never misbehaved. It took a frame inside a blink.
 *
 * Measured by hit-testing rather than by any box API. `getBoundingClientRect()`
 * and `getScreenCTM()` each disagree with the other engine about transformed SVG
 * — that is why check A skips in Blink — and this check has to be trusted in
 * Gecko above all, since that is where the defect lived. Hit-testing runs
 * against the geometry the engine paints, which is the thing under test.
