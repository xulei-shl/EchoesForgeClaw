/**
 * Composition gate — the one check that needs a real browser.
 *
 * `bun test` can prove a great deal about this library from strings alone, and
 * it proved nothing at all about the two failures that shipped: eyes that
 * deformed on the wrong axis, and a morph that never ran. Both live in the gap
 * between what the renderer emits and what a CSS engine does with it, and
 * nothing in a string can see across that gap.
 *
 * So this bundles the real source, loads it in headless Chrome, and measures
 * pixels. It is deliberately *not* a `bun test` file: it needs a browser on the
 * machine, and a test file that silently skips when one is missing is worse than
 * no test, because the suite still reports green. Run explicitly, and part of
 * `bun run check`, which warns loudly rather than passing quietly when there is
 * no Chrome to run.
 *
 * See `scripts/probe/entry.tsx` for what is actually asserted, and
 * `docs/motion-probe.html` for the hand-run probe of the idle layers, which this
 * does not replace — that one is about whether the motion *reads* well.

/* Has to sit on \`.mo-root\` itself: \`--mo-amp\` is declared on that element, and
   an element's own declaration beats an inherited one however important the
   ancestor's is. At amplitude 0 every idle layer folds to the identity, so what
   is left on screen is the pose and nothing else.

   \`--mo-shake\` is pinned for a different reason. It is not ambient — it is part
   of the pose — but it is the one pose channel the static path cannot express,
   because a bake is a still frame and a tremor is a loop. Leaving it running
   makes check A compare a shaking blobatar against a stationary one and report the
   phase it happened to sample as a divergence, which is exactly what it did:
   0.37px of "disagreement" that was the feature working. Check D below measures
   it properly, unfrozen. Check I does the same for the seesaw.

   The seesaw is pinned by its *phase* and not by its amplitude, which is the
   whole difference between it and the tremor: the bake can express it, at one
   phase. \`--mo-rockp: 1\` is frame zero, where \`(1 + wrap · phase) / 2\`
   collapses to \`--mo-sel\` and the composition has to land exactly on what
   \`bakePose\` emitted. Pinning \`--mo-rock: 0\` instead would also make A pass and
   would prove less: it would take the blend out of the measurement rather than
   asserting the identity the blend is built on. */
