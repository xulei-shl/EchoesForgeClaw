/**
 * **Deprecated — moved to `@blobatar/react`.**
 *
 * This entry point still works and still renders exactly what it always did.
 * It is frozen, not maintained in parallel: `@blobatar/react` re-exports this
 * component, so the two are the same object and cannot drift.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bunx blobatar-codemod .
 * bun add @blobatar/react
 * ```
 *
 * Removed in v3. Nothing else about the component changes when you move — same
 * props, same output, only the specifier.
 *
 * The reason it is still here rather than deleted: removing it is breaking, and
 * a break costs a major, and a major is how a consumer opts into their users'
 * faces changing (ADR-0008). Spending one on a repackaging would force every
 * consumer to take a new generation to get a new import path. So the two travel
 * separately, and this subpath waits for the major that was going to happen
 * anyway.

 * Two rendering modes, and the props follow the mode.

 * Static blobatars render as an `<img>`: a list of a few hundred is exactly the

 *
 * Animated blobatars cannot. Content inside an `<img>` is an isolated,
 * non-interactive document — `:hover` never fires inside it and host-page CSS
 * cannot reach the shapes — so `animate` switches to inline SVG and costs
 * roughly a dozen nodes per blobatar. That trade is the reason animation is
 * opt-in rather than a default.
 *
 * The union is deliberate: `onLoad` should stop type-checking the moment you

          Three real children rather than one innerHTML blob, and the reason is
          the morph.

          Only the third varies at runtime — its class does, when the expression
          changes — and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is all-or-nothing: had the root
          `<g>` stayed inside that string, every expression change would replace
          the entire subtree. A fresh element has no previous computed value, so
          no transition runs on it and every idle animation under it restarts
          from phase zero. Split this way, React writes one attribute and the
          DOM below survives, which is what the transition needs to exist at all.

          The first two have to be siblings of the root rather than inside it:
          `<title>` names the element it is the first child of, so nesting it
          would label a `<g>` instead of this `<svg>`, and the backdrop must sit
          outside the hover-lift or the plate scales with the creature.
