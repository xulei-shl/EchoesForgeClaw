/**
 * **Deprecated — moved to `@blobatar/vue`.**
 *
 * This entry point still works and still renders exactly what it always did.
 * It is frozen, not maintained in parallel: `@blobatar/vue` re-exports this
 * component, so the two are the same object and cannot drift.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bunx blobatar-codemod .
 * bun add @blobatar/vue
 * ```
 *
 * Removed in v3. Nothing else about the component changes when you move — same
 * props, same output, only the specifier.
 *
 * The reason it is still here rather than deleted: removing it is breaking, and
 * a break costs a major, and a major is how a consumer opts into their users'
 * faces changing (ADR-0008). Spending one on a repackaging would force every
 * consumer to take a new generation to get a new import path. So the two travel
 * separately, and this subpath waits for the major that was going to happen
 * anyway.

/**
 * Vue 3 adapter: the same two rendering modes as `blobatar/react`, behind the
 * same props.
 *
 * Static blobatars render as an `<img>`: a list of a few hundred is exactly the
 * case where you do not want extra DOM nodes per screen, and nothing here uses
 * `currentColor`, so inline SVG would buy nothing.
 *
 * Animated blobatars cannot. Content inside an `<img>` is an isolated,
 * non-interactive document — `:hover` never fires inside it and host-page CSS
 * cannot reach the shapes — so `animate` switches to inline SVG and costs
 * roughly a dozen nodes per blobatar. That trade is the reason animation is
 * opt-in rather than a default. See `react.tsx` for the full argument; none of
 * it is framework-specific.
 *
 * A render function rather than a template or an SFC: the same `setup()` then
 * works in `<script setup>`, in a plain `setup()` return, and under
 * `defineComponent` — no template compiler in the loop, and no SFC pre-step for
 * a consumer to configure. Vue's `h()` renders real SVG elements natively, so
 * there is no JSX runtime to externalize either.
 *
 * Everything not declared as a prop — `class`, `style`, `alt`, `aria-*`,
 * event listeners, `data-*` — flows through Vue's `attrs` onto whichever
 * element the mode renders, the same way `rest` spreads onto the DOM node in
 * the React adapter.

   *
   * - A prop whose type list contains `Boolean` is cast to `false` when the
   *   caller omits it. That is right for a template flag and wrong for an
   *   option: `background` reaches the renderer as `opts.background ??
   *   style.background`, so an injected `false` reads as "transparent" rather
   *   than "unset" and the caller loses any way to ask for the style's own
   *   backdrop.
   * - Restating a core default here (`default: true`) puts it in two places
   *   that can drift apart, and drift between the adapters is the one thing
   *   `test/adapters.test.ts` exists to prevent.
   *
   * Declaring `default: undefined` is not the same as omitting `default`:
   * Vue checks for the key's presence, not its value, and the cast is skipped
   * on that check.
