 * `@blobatar/solid` — the Solid adapter.
 *
 * Written in Solid JSX and compiled by `babel-preset-solid`, which is the
 * thing ADR-0009 split the packages to make possible. An earlier attempt at
 * three adapters as subpaths of core could not hold five mutually
 * incompatible JSX transforms in one `Bun.build` call, gave up, and hand-rolled
 * `document.createElementNS` instead — shipping a Preact adapter that rendered
 * an empty string. Build isolation is what this package spends its existence
 * on; `scripts/build.ts` is where it collects it.
 *
 * So: no DOM construction here. Anything written against `document` renders
 * nowhere there is no `document`, which is every SSR consumer and the harness
 * row that would have caught the empty string.
