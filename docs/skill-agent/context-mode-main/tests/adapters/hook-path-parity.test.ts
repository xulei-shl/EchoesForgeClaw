/**
 * Cross-adapter parity test for issue #712.
 *
 * For every adapter whose `buildHookCommand` emits an absolute filesystem
 * path (i.e. NOT a CLI-dispatcher Tier C adapter — vscode-copilot,
 * jetbrains-copilot, cursor, codex deliberately emit
 * `context-mode hook <platform> <event>` strings and are excluded), the
 * emitted command MUST resolve to a script that exists in the published
 * tree under the same relative layout HOOK_MAP in src/cli.ts uses.
 *
 * Why this test exists: issue #712 — gemini-cli's `buildHookCommand`
 * carried claude-code's flat `hooks/<script>` shape across without
 * accounting for the `gemini-cli/` platform subdir. HOOK_MAP knew the
 * correct layout, `setHookPermissions` knew the correct layout, but the
 * command emit didn't — and the gemini-cli doctor's regex round-trip
 * (`getHookScriptPaths` -> parse command -> check existsSync on parsed
 * path) silently failed on every install.
 *
 * This test trips at the emit layer: the script path embedded in the
 * command must existsSync in the actual tree being tested. No regex,
 * no parsing, no fragile string scraping — just "does the file the
 * command points at actually exist?".
 *
 * Adapters NOT covered here (CLI-dispatcher Tier C):
 *   - vscode-copilot  (PR #620, .github/hooks/context-mode.json is
 *                      workspace-committed; absolute paths leak PII)
 *   - jetbrains-copilot (same as above; .jetbrains/copilot/hooks.json)
 *   - cursor           (CLI dispatcher in .cursor/hooks.json)
 *   - codex            (CLI dispatcher in ~/.codex/hooks.json)
