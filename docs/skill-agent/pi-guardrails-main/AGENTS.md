# pi-guardrails

Public Pi extension providing security hooks to prevent potentially dangerous operations. People could be using this, so consider backwards compatibility when making changes.

Pi is pre-1.0.0, so breaking changes can happen between Pi versions. This extension must stay up to date with Pi or things will break.

## Stack

- TypeScript (strict mode)
- pnpm 10.26.1
- Vitest for testing
- Biome for linting/formatting
- Changesets for versioning
- `@aliou/sh` for built-in dangerous command AST parsing

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm test             # Run tests
pnpm test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm typecheck        # Type check
pnpm gen:schema       # Regenerate schema.json from config types
pnpm check:schema     # Verify schema.json is up to date
pnpm lint             # Lint (runs on pre-commit)
pnpm format           # Format
pnpm changeset        # Create changeset for versioning
pnpm version          # Bump versions from changesets
pnpm release          # Publish package from changesets
pnpm check:lockfile   # Verify pnpm-lock.yaml is in sync

```

The package registers four independent extensions. The three Guardrails features each own one Pi `tool_call` hook and communicate feature presence through the Pi event bus. The Herdr adapter owns no tool hook and only maps prompt lifecycle events to `herdr:blocked`.

## Conventions

- Tests live next to the code they test (`src/core/check.test.ts`, `extensions/guardrails/rules.test.ts`, etc.).
- Prefer unit tests of `core`/`extension` helpers over loading the full extension factory. Use `memfs` for filesystem state.
- Hook tests can call the `setupXxxHook()` function from an extension's `index.ts` with a minimal mock `pi` object and `vi.fn()` spies for contexts.
- Built-in dangerous command matching uses AST parsing via `@aliou/sh`; user-configured patterns use substring/regex matching.
- File protection is policy-based (`features.policies`, `policies.rules`), not legacy `envFiles`.
- Config migrations are predicate-based (`shouldRun`) using structural checks; do not rely on lexicographic version string comparisons.
- Runtime code must only handle current config/core shapes. Old config shapes belong exclusively in migrations; do not add runtime compatibility branches for legacy config.
- `config.version` is a schema marker for debugging/inspection, not the package version.
- Events emitted on the pi event bus for inter-extension communication are defined in `src/shared/events.ts`. Current public events are `guardrails:action:blocked`, `guardrails:prompt:opened`, `guardrails:prompt:closed`, `guardrails:risk:detected`, `guardrails:feature:request`, and `guardrails:feature:register`. `guardrails:action:prompted` is a deprecated alias for `guardrails:prompt:opened`.

## Documentation

When adding, updating, or removing default policy rules, default permission gate patterns, or example presets:

- Update `schema.json` with `pnpm gen:schema` if config types changed.
- Update `README.md` if public behavior, commands, or discovery flow changed.
- Treat `src/shared/config/defaults.ts` and `extensions/guardrails/commands/settings/examples.ts` as the source of truth for defaults and presets.

## Versioning

Uses changesets. Run `pnpm changeset` before committing user-facing changes.

- `patch`: bug fixes
- `minor`: new features/hooks
- `major`: breaking changes
