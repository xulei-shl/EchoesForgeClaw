/**

 * but those paths change between Pi versions (e.g. Nix store hashes), so we
 * resolve them directly from Pi's package asset path helpers instead of
 * scraping the system prompt or persisting concrete paths in config.
 *
 * These helpers honor `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` (Nix/Guix) and walk to the package
 * root for npm global installs and Bun binaries, so they always match the
 * Pi version actually running. They depend only on the process environment
 * and are fixed for the process lifetime — resolve once, no per-turn work.
 *
 * The README is a single file grant; docs and examples are directory grants.
 *
 * If the helpers are not exported by the runtime (e.g. Oh My Pi), this
 * returns an empty array so the extension can still load and only the
 * documentation grants are skipped.
