# @aliou/pi-guardrails

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 0f5d007: Fix path-access filtering for interpreter arguments so API-style paths passed to scripts are not treated as outside-workspace filesystem access while inline interpreter code remains guarded.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- ffc7ca7: path-access: filter non-path bash arguments by shape and filesystem
  plausibility instead of per-command allow-lists.

  Arguments that look like paths but are not (Context7 library IDs such as
  `/websites/apisix`, Go package patterns like `./...`, URLs, `user@host:` remote
  targets, `docker -v /src:/dst` volume specs) no longer trigger outside-workspace
  prompts, for every CLI rather than an enumerated list.

  Filtering never applies to redirect targets, interpreter programs, commands
  that create missing parent directories, or tokens holding an unexpanded shell
  reference, so real outside-workspace access is still surfaced.

  The `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `jq`, and `go` classifiers are removed as redundant.
  Interpreter, `find`, and delimiter (`cut`/`sort`/`tr`) handling is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- dcd815b: Make Pi documentation path grants optional so the extension loads in Oh My Pi.

  `extensions/path-access/dynamic-resources.ts` no longer statically imports named `getReadmePath`, `getDocsPath`, and `getExamplesPath` helpers from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. When those helpers are unavailable (e.g. under Oh My Pi), documentation grants are skipped instead of failing extension validation.

- ad2c8d7: Adopt @aliou/pi-utils-settings 0.19.1 and switch migrations to package semver versions.
- 0a15f3f: Fix secret-files (and other `onlyIfExists`) policies being bypassed when a bash
  target path contains an unexpanded shell expansion such as `$VAR`, `${VAR}`,
  `$(...)`, `$((...))`, or process substitution.

  Previously, a command like `head "$SC/.env"` extracted the literal target
  `$SC/.env`. The `.env` basename matched the policy, but the policy's
  `onlyIfExists` check then `stat()`'d `<cwd>/$SC/.env` — a path that never
  exists — and let the read through.

  Target extraction now marks such paths as unresolved, and the policy check no
  longer applies `onlyIfExists` to them: a path we can't resolve can't be used to
  prove a file doesn't exist. This follows ShellCheck's stance that shell
  indirection is "known to be unsolvable in the most general case" — unresolved
  references are treated conservatively rather than optimistically.

## 0.16.2

### Patch Changes

- b9d319c: Fix bogus "Outside Workspace Access" prompts on Windows for `find <dir> \( ... \) | xargs grep ...` commands (#79). Escaped parens in find expressions produced a lone `\` token that resolved to the drive root (`D:\`) on Windows, and grep patterns passed through `xargs` were treated as paths. Requires @aliou/sh ^0.2.2, which fixes backslash escape tokenization.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 79ce17b: Show bash commands inside path-access prompts, with a toggle for truncated commands.
- a64c8b4: Reduce path-access prompt height by grouping approval actions when space allows.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- fff80de: Add correlated prompt lifecycle events and report active approval prompts to Herdr.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f0d736: Add a "decline and stop" option to the permission-gate prompt. Choosing it (press `s`, or select "Decline and stop" in the RPC fallback) blocks the dangerous command, emits a `guardrails:action:blocked` event with the new `user-stop` block source, and aborts the current agent turn so the assistant does not keep going.

### Patch Changes

- 09934f0: Update AGENTS.md to reflect the current three-extension layout and remove the unused, broken test harness.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 86aa055: Fix repeated guardrails startup warnings caused by allowed path migrations re-running on current `{ kind, path }` entries.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- e012ea0: Migrate `pathAccess.allowedPaths` from a flat `string[]` (trailing-slash convention) to an explicit `{ kind, path }` discriminated array.

  - `file` grants match the exact path; `directory` grants match the directory and its descendants.
  - Removes the implicit trailing-slash convention from config, storage, and runtime access matching.
  - Fixes skill `baseDir` grants being matched as exact files instead of directory boundaries.
  - Adds migration `010-allowed-paths-objects` to convert existing string entries; `009` made format-agnostic so it no longer re-runs on migrated configs.
  - Settings UI `Allowed paths` editor now toggles kind per entry (Tab) instead of relying on trailing slashes.
  - Regenerates `schema.json` with the new `AllowedPath` definition.
  - Bumps `@aliou/pi-utils-settings` to `^0.17.0` and switches migrations to its built-in `Migration.message` field. Migration warnings now flow through `ConfigLoader.drainMessages()` instead of guardrails' manual `addPendingWarning` queue (which is retained only for non-migration warnings like invalid regex patterns). The `001` config-backup failure path drops to `console.error`.

### Patch Changes

- a7f2980: Bump `@aliou/pi-utils-settings` to `^0.17.0` and switch migration warnings to its built-in `Migration.message` field.

  - Migration warnings now flow through `ConfigLoader.drainMessages()` (drained and rendered in the `session_start` handler) instead of guardrails' manual `addPendingWarning` queue.
  - The `001` config-backup failure path drops to `console.error` (it fires on an error path, not a successful run, so it cannot use the `message` field).
  - Removes the now-unused `src/shared/warnings.ts` module. Invalid-regex handling in pattern compilation silently matches nothing for now (TODO: surface via `ctx.ui.notify` once compilation is pre-cached at setup).

## 0.13.3

### Patch Changes

- 9674ac5: Stamp guardrails config saves with the current schema version.

  This prevents newly-created partial configs from being mistaken for legacy v0 configs on reload.

- 17ae843: Use regex for git force-push example to catch the flag at any position.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 22f51a9: Fix feature and permission gate toggles storing display strings instead of booleans

  Toggling `features.*` or `permissionGate.requireConfirmation` in the settings command stored the raw display string ("enabled"/"disabled", "on"/"off") instead of converting to `true`/`false`. Since any non-empty string is truthy, features appeared stuck "on" when toggled to "disabled" or "off".

- 8a1996a: Make onboarding status toggleable in global settings

  Onboarding status was a read-only label with no way to reset it. Now toggleable between "completed" and "pending" so users can re-run onboarding after a Pi reload.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- b8e1fac: Loosen Pi core peer dependency ranges so guardrails can install with newer Pi versions.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f4f478: Add `guardrails:action:prompted` event that fires when guardrails shows an interactive prompt to the user, before the user has responded. This complements the existing `guardrails:action:blocked` (post-decision) and `guardrails:risk:detected` events.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 6c149e5: Fix go package wildcards (./...) incorrectly treated as file paths, blocking commands like `go test ./...`

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- bd90cdf: Remove the permission gate command explainer and its subagent runtime.
- 5cef4eb: Split Guardrails into separate policy, path-access, and permission-gate extensions backed by shared config, generated JSON schema support, and refreshed README documentation.

  Breaking: renamed public event bus events to `guardrails:action:blocked`, `guardrails:risk:detected`, `guardrails:feature:request`, and `guardrails:feature:register`. Blocked and risk events now use core `Action` and `Safety` payload shapes.

### Patch Changes

- 7b01ab4: Move config migrations into shared modules and only show onboarding when no guardrails config exists.
- 5d76145: Update settings utilities to the latest version.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 3a37eab: Avoid treating regex-like command arguments as filesystem paths in shell guardrails.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 562e90f: Fix path access allowed paths settings to read and write string arrays, and migrate configs written with pattern objects.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 11e88c0: Fix dd pattern (if= to of=) and expand dangerous command detection

  Fixed the dd pattern to check for of= (output file) instead of if= (input file),
  as of= is the actual dangerous write operation. Also extracted dangerous command
  matchers to a separate module and added new patterns for:

  - Privilege escalation: doas, pkexec
  - Secure destruction: shred, wipefs, blkdiscard
  - Disk partitioning: fdisk, sfdisk, cfdisk, parted, sgdisk
  - Container escapes: docker/podman run with --privileged, --pid=host,
    --network=host, --userns=host, root mounts, docker socket mounts

  Improved existing matchers to handle long options like --recursive,
  --force, etc.

  Fixes #22

- ba06d72: Add path access feature: restrict tool access to current working directory with allow/ask/block modes. Grants can be file-level (exact match) or directory-level (trailing slash convention). Session grants persist in memory, project grants persist in local config.

### Patch Changes

- 2db56c2: Fix permission gate bypass in RPC mode: deny-by-default when `ctx.ui.custom()` returns undefined, with fallback to `ctx.ui.select()`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 6356335: Add command-based onboarding for new users.

  - add `/guardrails:onboarding` command and session-start hint when setup is pending
  - replace auto-open onboarding with explicit overlay flow
  - add onboarding completion marker for config compatibility and first-run state
  - improve onboarding wizard copy and defaults/recap UX

### Patch Changes

- 828c019: Fix dangerous command confirmation UI scrolling for long multi-line commands.
- 97597c2: Fix home-directory default policy rules so `~`-based patterns match correctly and expand to the current user's home directory during blocking and existence checks.

## 0.9.5

### Patch Changes

- da0f0b7: chore: update Pi peer and dev package versions to 0.61.0

  - update `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, and `@mariozechner/pi-tui` to `0.61.0`
  - verify the extension against Pi 0.61.0 changelogs and docs
  - confirm no source-level migration was needed for namespaced keybinding ids or tool wrapper execute signatures

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- d5047c5: fix: update `@aliou/pi-utils-settings` to 0.10.1 for nested wizard Ctrl+S handling

  - pulls in the `pi-utils-settings` fix that lets nested settings submenus receive `Ctrl+S` before the top-level settings screen intercepts save
  - fixes the add-policy flow so the review step can submit with `Ctrl+S`

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- f20cce2: Add Homebrew and Docker secret command examples to the permission gate presets in the Examples tab.
- ae512a6: Add more policy and command examples in settings UI

  File policy presets:

  - SSH keys (_.pem, _\_rsa, \*\_ed25519)
  - AWS credentials (.aws/credentials, .aws/config)
  - Database files (_.db, _.sqlite, \*.sqlite3) - read-only
  - Kubernetes secrets (.kube/config, _kubeconfig_)
  - Certificates (_.crt, _.key, \*.p12)

  Dangerous command presets:

  - terraform apply/destroy
  - kubectl delete
  - docker system prune
  - git push --force
  - npm/yarn/pnpm publish
  - DROP DATABASE/TABLE

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 9cd0054: bump @aliou/pi-utils-settings to ^0.10.0 (local scope fix)

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- a01452d: Fix policy file glob matching for nested paths like `drizzle/**/*.sql` by using native Node glob matching on normalized relative targets.

  This keeps basename matching for simple patterns (for backward compatibility), while allowing patterns with `/` to match full relative paths as users expect.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 78f640d: Improve settings UX with guided policy creation and top-level examples tab.

  - Add a real wizard flow for creating a new policy in settings (name, protection, patterns, review), then open the policy editor.
  - Move policy examples into a dedicated top-level `Examples` tab using `extraTabs`.
  - Ask target scope each time an example is applied; do not persist last selected scope.
  - Upgrade `@aliou/pi-utils-settings` to `^0.8.0` to use `extraTabs` and combined settings theme support.
  - Keep pattern editor compact while preserving `Ctrl+R` regex toggle in form mode.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e8eea2f: Redesign file protection from legacy `envFiles` to a new `policies` system with per-rule protection levels (`noAccess`, `readOnly`, `none`), add migration from old config fields, and replace the old env hook with a general policies hook.
- e762afc: Add opt-in LLM command explanations to the permission gate dialog with configurable model and timeout settings, plus graceful fallback when model resolution or explanation calls fail.

### Patch Changes

- e4a8438: Update docs and migration semantics for config schema versioning. Bump `@aliou/pi-utils-settings` to latest `0.5.x`, clarify fallback behavior in README/AGENTS, ignore `.pi/settings.json`, and ensure migrated configs write the current schema version without lexicographic version comparisons.
- d9f91cd: Harden permission-gate command explanation prompt handling, fix dangerous-pattern matching flow after successful AST parses, and improve policy enforcement by skipping empty rules and resolving onlyIfExists checks relative to session cwd. Also refresh README/AGENTS docs for the policies-based architecture.

## 0.7.7

### Patch Changes

- 0b5ab5b: Move `@mariozechner/pi-tui` to peer dependencies to avoid bundling the SDK alongside the extension.
- 3ea037a: Replace all `console.error`/`console.warn` calls with a module-level warnings queue. Warnings collected during config loading, migration, and pattern compilation are now drained and reported via `ctx.ui.notify` at `session_start`.

## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- 31ae8f0: mark pi SDK peer deps as optional to prevent koffi OOM in Gondolin VMs

### Patch Changes

- 024c9a4: Fix false positives in permission gate when dangerous keywords appear inside command arguments (e.g. "sudo" in a git commit message). When structural AST matching succeeds, skip the redundant substring match on the raw command string.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 9ba0cb9: Add "allow for session" option to permission gate confirmation dialog. Pressing `a` saves the command as an allowed pattern in the memory scope, bypassing future prompts for the same command in the current session.
- Updated dependencies [756552a]

  - New `enforcePackageManager` feature (disabled by default)
  - Supports npm, pnpm, and bun (npm is default)
  - Blocks commands using non-selected package managers
  - Configurable via `packageManager.selected` setting
  - Also documents the existing `preventPython` feature

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- dcaa485: Type-safe feature settings: derive settings UI items from a typed record keyed by config feature keys. Adding a new feature without updating the settings UI now causes a type error.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9916f1f: Add preventPython guardrail to block Python tools.

  - Block python, python3, pip, pip3, poetry, pyenv, virtualenv, and venv commands.
