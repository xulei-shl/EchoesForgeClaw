# How to use

[Models.dev](https://models.dev/) is a comprehensive open-source database of AI model specifications, pricing, and features.

The homepage starts with provider-agnostic model metadata. Model pages list the providers serving that model; provider pages list every model available from that provider; lab pages group canonical models by author.

## API

You can access provider data, provider-agnostic model metadata, or the combined catalog through JSON endpoints.

```
curl https://models.dev/api.json
curl https://models.dev/models.json
curl https://models.dev/catalog.json
```

## Logos

Provider logos are available at `/logos/{provider}.svg` where `{provider}` is the provider ID. Lab logos are available at `/logos/labs/{lab}.svg`.

```
curl https://models.dev/logos/anthropic.svg
```

## SDK

Use the SDK to query the API from your app. It's type-safe and exports the latest snapshot for offline use.

```
npm install @opencode-ai/models
```

## Contribute

The data is stored in [GitHub](https://github.com/anomalyco/models.dev) as TOML files organized by provider and canonical model.

# Readme

[Models.dev](https://models.dev) is a comprehensive open-source database of AI model specifications, pricing, and capabilities.

There's no single database with information about all the available AI models. We started Models.dev as a community-contributed project to address this. We also use it internally in [opencode](https://opencode.ai).

## API

You can access this data through an API.

```bash
curl https://models.dev/api.json
```

Use the **Model ID** field to do a lookup on any model; it's the identifier used by [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/).

Provider-agnostic model metadata is available separately:

```bash
curl https://models.dev/models.json
```

Use this for facts about the model itself, independent of where it is served. If you need both provider endpoints and model-only metadata in one response:

```bash
curl https://models.dev/catalog.json
```

### Logos

Provider logos are available as SVG files:

```bash
curl https://models.dev/logos/{provider}.svg
```

Replace `{provider}` with the **Provider ID** (e.g., `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`). If we don't have a provider's logo, a default logo is served instead.

## Contributing

The data is stored in the repo as TOML files; organized by provider and model. The logo is stored as an SVG. This is used to generate this page and power the API.

We need your help keeping the data up to date.

### Adding Model Metadata

Model-only facts live in `models/`, using the same path-style IDs as provider models. For example, `models/openai/gpt-5.toml` defines metadata for the underlying GPT-5 model, while `providers/openai/models/gpt-5.toml` defines OpenAI-specific serving details such as pricing.

Use model metadata for provider-agnostic facts:

- `name`, `family`, `release_date`, `last_updated`, `knowledge`
- `attachment`, `reasoning`, `tool_call`, `structured_output`, `temperature`
- `[limit]` defaults like context, input, and output token limits
- `[modalities]` defaults
- `open_weights`, `license`, `links`, `weights`, and `benchmarks`

Example:

```toml
name = "GPT-5"
family = "gpt"
release_date = "2025-08-07"
last_updated = "2025-08-07"
attachment = true
reasoning = true
temperature = false
tool_call = true
structured_output = true
open_weights = false

[limit]
context = 400_000
input = 272_000
output = 128_000

[modalities]
input = ["text", "image"]
output = ["text"]

[[benchmarks]]
name = "Benchmark Name"
score = 72.5
metric = "accuracy"
source = "https://example.com/results"

[[weights]]
label = "Model weights"
url = "https://huggingface.co/example/model"
format = "safetensors"
```

Provider TOMLs can inherit these facts with `base_model` and then keep only provider-specific fields or overrides:

```toml
base_model = "openai/gpt-5"

[cost]
input = 1.25
output = 10.00
cache_read = 0.125

[limit]
context = 200_000 # optional provider override
output = 32_000
```

Provider fields win over model metadata during generation. Use this when the underlying model is the same but a provider serves it with different context limits, modalities, features, or pricing.

### Adding a New Provider Model

To add a new model, start by checking if the provider already exists in the `providers/` directory. If not, then:

#### 1. Create a Provider

If the provider isn't already in `providers/`:

1. Create a new folder in `providers/` with the provider's ID. For example, `providers/newprovider/`.
2. Add a `provider.toml` with the provider details:

   ```toml
   name = "Provider Name"
   npm = "@ai-sdk/provider" # AI SDK Package name
   env = ["PROVIDER_API_KEY"] # Environment Variable keys used for auth
   doc = "https://example.com/docs/models" # Link to provider's documentation
   ```

   If the provider doesn’t publish an npm package but exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, set the npm field accordingly and include the base URL:

   ```toml
   npm = "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible" # Use OpenAI-compatible SDK
   api = "https://api.example.com/v1" # Required with openai-compatible
   ```

#### 2. Add a Logo (required for new providers)

To add a logo for the provider:

1. Add a `logo.svg` file to the provider's directory (e.g., `providers/newprovider/logo.svg`)
2. Use SVG format with no fixed size or colors - use `currentColor` for fills/strokes

Example SVG structure:

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor">
  <!-- Logo paths here -->
</svg>
```

#### 3. Add a Model Definition

Create a new TOML file in the provider's `models/` directory where the filename is the model ID.

If the model ID contains `/`, use subfolders. For example, for the model ID `openai/gpt-5`, create a folder `openai/` and place a file named `gpt-5.toml` inside it.

```toml
name = "Model Display Name"
attachment = true           # or false - supports file attachments
reasoning = false           # or true - supports reasoning / chain-of-thought
tool_call = true            # or false - supports tool calling
structured_output = true    # or false - supports a dedicated structured output feature
temperature = true          # or false - supports temperature control
knowledge = "2024-04"       # Knowledge-cutoff date
release_date = "2025-02-19" # First public release date
last_updated = "2025-02-19" # Most recent update date
open_weights = true         # or false  - model’s trained weights are publicly available

[cost]
input = 3.00                # Cost per million input tokens (USD)
output = 15.00              # Cost per million output tokens (USD)
reasoning = 15.00           # Cost per million reasoning tokens (USD)
cache_read = 0.30           # Cost per million cached read tokens (USD)
cache_write = 3.75          # Cost per million cached write tokens (USD)
input_audio = 1.00          # Cost per million audio input tokens (USD)
output_audio = 10.00        # Cost per million audio output tokens (USD)

[limit]
context = 400_000           # Maximum context window (tokens)
input = 272_000             # Maximum input tokens
output = 8_192              # Maximum output tokens

[modalities]
input = ["text", "image"]   # Supported input modalities
output = ["text"]           # Supported output modalities

[interleaved]
field = "reasoning_content" # Name of the interleaved field "reasoning_content" or "reasoning_details"
```

#### 3a. Reuse Model Metadata with `base_model`

For wrapper providers that mirror an existing model, prefer referencing the model-only metadata instead of duplicating provider-agnostic fields.

Use `base_model` when the provider serves the same underlying model and only provider-specific fields differ.

```toml
base_model = "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"
# Match lab/peer controls for this model (not a stripped L/M/H guess)
reasoning_options = [
  { type = "effort", values = ["low", "medium", "high", "max"] },
  { type = "budget_tokens", min = 1_024 },
]

[cost]
input = 5.00
output = 25.00
```

Rules:

- `base_model` must point to a TOML file in `models/` using `<provider>/<model-id>`.
- **Override-only:** after `base_model`, write only provider-specific fields and values that **differ** from the base. Do not restate the same `description`, `structured_output`, `modalities`, `tool_call`, dates, etc.
- You may override any top-level model field when the provider actually differs.
- If you override a nested table like `[cost]`, `[limit]`, or `[modalities]`, include the full values needed for that table (arrays/primitives replace; plain objects deep-merge).
- `base_model_omit` is optional and removes inherited model metadata fields after local overrides are merged. Use dot-path strings, for example `base_model_omit = ["limit.input"]`.
- Provider-specific fields (`cost`, `reasoning_options`, `interleaved`, `status`, `provider`, `experimental`) belong on the provider model when needed.
- `id` still comes from the filename; do not add it to the TOML.

**Reasoning options (short):** classify first-party lab vs multi-model relay (not by npm). Copy the underlying model’s controls from the lab entry and same-surface peers — often `low`/`medium`/`high` on GPT-style relays, but DeepSeek V4 is `toggle`+`high`/`max`, etc. Do not use `[]` from uncertainty on relays. Full policy: `AGENTS.md`.

Use `base_model` when the wrapper model is materially the same as the source model and only differs by provider-specific pricing, limits, modalities, provider request shape, or lifecycle flags.

Sync and generator scripts should preserve existing `base_model` / `base_model_omit` fields when updating provider TOMLs. Do not use legacy `[extends]` tables.

### Validation

There's a GitHub Action that will automatically validate your submission against our schema to ensure:

- All required fields are present
- Data types are correct
- Values are within acceptable ranges
- TOML syntax is valid

When moving existing provider fields into model metadata, compare generated output before and after the change:

```bash
bun run compare:migrations
```

This prints a diff for each changed model TOML so you can confirm the generated JSON only changed where you intended.
