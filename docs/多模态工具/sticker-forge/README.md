# Sticker Forge

Sticker Forge turns text or uploaded image artwork into a tactile WebGL sticker. Grab the
real die-cut edge, drag it inward, and the sticker curls to reveal a satin back
surface with depth-aware shadowing.

The repository contains two deliverables:

- an interactive builder in `app/`;
- a framework-independent Web Component and imperative API in `lib/`.

## Run locally

Node.js 22.13 or newer is required.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build the hosted app and both reusable library bundles with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The reusable files are emitted to `public/embed/`:

- `sticker-forge.es.js` — an ES module that auto-registers `<sticker-forge>`;
- `sticker-forge.iife.js` — a classic script exposing `window.StickerForge`;
- `sticker-forge.d.ts` — public TypeScript declarations.

## GitHub Pages

Pushes to `main` deploy a static export through the GitHub Pages workflow at
`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. Build the same artifact locally with:

```bash
npm run build:pages
```

The production Pages site uses `https://sticker.oooo.so`. Its DNS record is a
`CNAME` for the `sticker` subdomain pointing to `catsjuice.github.io`.

The provided peel sound is trimmed, converted to mono, lightly high-passed, and
inlined into both JavaScript bundles, so it does not need to be copied or hosted
as a separate asset. The untouched source recording remains in `lib/assets/`.

## Copy-paste Web Component

Copy both the ES bundle and this markup into any page. The bundle registers the
element automatically; the idempotent `defineStickerForge()` helper is also
exported and returns immediately (`void`).

```html
<script type="module" src="/embed/sticker-forge.es.js"></script>

<sticker-forge
  id="sticker"
  style="display:block;width:640px;height:420px"
></sticker-forge>

<script type="module">
  await customElements.whenDefined("sticker-forge");
  const sticker = document.querySelector("#sticker");

  sticker.setOptions({
    outline: { width: 18, color: "#ffffff" },
    shadow: { opacity: 0.22, blur: 22, distance: 16, angle: 42 },
    lighting: {
      direction: { x: -0.38, y: 0.52, z: 0.76 },
      intensity: 0.8,
      ambient: 0.35,
      softness: 0.6,
    },
    peel: {
      radius: 0.12,
      stiffness: 0.72,
      maxAngle: 3.55,
      release: "reset",
    },
    sound: { enabled: true, volume: 0.68 },
    back: { color: "#f7f5f2", gloss: 0.7, roughness: 0.3 },
    material: {
      type: "holographic",
      intensity: 0.86,
      scale: 1,
    },
    tilt: -3,
  });

  // setSource() is async: the promise settles after the texture is ready.
  await sticker.setSource({
    type: "text",
    text: "PEEL ME",
    color: "#19191d",
    fontFamily: "Arial Rounded MT Bold, Arial Black, sans-serif",
    fontWeight: 900,
  });

  sticker.addEventListener("peelchange", (event) => {
    console.log("peel", event.detail.progress);
  });
</script>
```

See [`examples/embed.html`](examples/embed.html) for a complete standalone page.

## Imperative JavaScript API

If a custom element does not fit the host framework, mount the renderer into a
normal element. `createSticker()` is asynchronous and resolves to the control
object; renderer events are dispatched from the target element.

```html
<div id="sticker-target" style="width:640px;height:420px"></div>

<script type="module">
  import { createSticker } from "/embed/sticker-forge.es.js";

  const target = document.querySelector("#sticker-target");
  target.addEventListener("peelend", (event) => {
    console.log("released at", event.detail.progress);
  });

  const sticker = await createSticker(target, {
    source: { type: "text", text: "PEEL ME", color: "#19191d" },
    peel: { radius: 0.12, maxAngle: 3.55 },
    sound: { enabled: true, volume: 0.68 },
  });

  // Call before permanently removing the target in an SPA.
  // sticker.destroy();
</script>
```

For classic scripts, load `sticker-forge.iife.js` and call
`await StickerForge.createSticker(...)`, as demonstrated by the standalone
example.

## Inputs

Text sources accept `text`, `color`, `fontFamily`, and `fontWeight`. The engine
waits for the requested browser font before rebuilding the texture.

Image sources accept any browser-decodable image URL, including data URLs made
from PNG, WebP, JPEG, GIF, AVIF, or SVG uploads:

```js
await sticker.setSource({ type: "image", src: imageDataUrl, name: file.name });
```

The engine inspects decoded pixel alpha. Transparent images use their alpha
silhouette for the die-cut outline; fully opaque images use their rectangular
image boundary.

Legacy SVG sources also accept raw markup; pre-sanitization is not required:

```js
await sticker.setSource({ type: "svg", svg: svgMarkup });
```

SVG input is processed locally. The library always removes scripts, event
attributes, `foreignObject`, and external URL references before rasterization.
`sanitizeSvgMarkup(svgMarkup)` is exported when the sanitized markup itself is
needed.

## API

The custom element and the object returned by the awaited `createSticker()`
promise expose the same control surface:

```ts
setSource(source): Promise<void>
setOptions(partialOptions): void
reset(): void
resize(): void
getState(): StickerState
destroy(): void
```

For the imperative API, listen on the target element passed to
`createSticker()`. For the Web Component, listen on `<sticker-forge>`; its peel
and error events bubble across the shadow boundary.

| Event | `event.detail` |
| --- | --- |
| `ready` | Imperative target: `{ width, height }`; Web Component: no detail |
| `peelstart` | `{ amount, progress, origin }` |
| `peelchange` | `{ amount, progress, direction? }` |
| `peelend` | `{ amount, progress, willReset }` |
| `detachcomplete` | `{ progress: 1 }` |
| `error` | `{ message }` |

`amount` and `progress` are the same normalized value from `0` (flat) to `1`
(fully lifted). `origin` and `direction` are `{ x, y }` points in sticker-local
coordinates.

`peel.radius` is normalized to the sticker's short side (`0.12` means 12%),
while `peel.maxAngle` is expressed in radians. `lighting.direction` is a
normalized view-space vector pointing from the sticker toward the incoming
directional light; it drives surface shading and projected-shadow direction
together. `lighting.intensity` supports `0..1.5`, while
`lighting.ambient` and `lighting.softness` use `0..1`. Shadow blur/distance use
CSS pixels, `tilt` is expressed in degrees, and `peel.grabWidth` uses CSS pixels
at 100% scale and scales with the sticker.

The bundled recording is treated as an audio sprite rather than a timeline.
Sticker Forge separates its lift, light crackle, strong tear, and release
material, compensates for their different levels, and drives randomized grains from
the drag velocity and acceleration. A slow peel is sparse, a fast peel is denser
and brighter, holding still is silent, and reattaching uses a quieter low-passed
texture instead of reversed audio. `progress` is used only for the initial lift
and final release events. Set `sound.enabled` to `false` or `sound.volume` to `0`
to mute it. Provide `sound.src` to replace the bundled sound with another
browser-decodable audio URL; custom recordings use a duration-relative generic
slice profile.

`setOptions()` deep-merges nested option groups. Prefer the awaitable
`setSource()` when changing artwork; passing `source` through `setOptions()`
starts the same rebuild but cannot be awaited. `destroy()` should be called
before a single-page application permanently removes an imperative sticker
instance. A disconnected `<sticker-forge>` cleans itself up automatically.

### Front materials

Set `material.type` to `original`, `holographic`, `glitter`, or `reflective`.
`original` is the default and uses the same front rendering as Sticker Forge
before selectable finishes were introduced. The other three finishes are
procedural, respond to the live surface normal while peeling, and remain
deterministic in Gallery previews and recorded exports.

Use `material.intensity` in the `0..1` range and `material.scale` to resize
procedural detail. `material.seed` keeps glitter flakes and similar detail
stable between frames.

## Rendering notes

- Three.js manages the WebGL scene, camera, geometry, and depth buffer.
- Custom shaders keep the attached region rigid and bend only the peel front.
- Front and back materials render separately according to face orientation.
- The shadow is projected from the deformed surface instead of being a static
  box or CSS shadow.
- Source alpha drives both visual clipping and boundary hit testing, so empty
  corners of an SVG bounding box cannot be grabbed.
- Rendering idles when the sticker is flat; DPR and mesh density are capped for
  predictable mobile performance.
