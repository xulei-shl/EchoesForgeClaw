## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hybrid Rendering System**: Seamlessly switch between efficient tile-based mapping (Leaflet) and procedural vector artistry (MapLibre GL).
- **Precision Geocoding**: Instant global location search powered by the Nominatim API.
- **Dynamic Markers**: Place, drag, and style multiple location indicators with various icons and adjustable sizes.
- **Custom Travel Paths**: Visualize journeys or specific itineraries with integrated route plotting and dynamic path fetching.
- **Mat / Passepartout Framing**: Apply a classic gallery-style framing effect with customizable width, border thickness, and opacity.
- **Elegant Typography**: A curated selection of premium fonts with full support for custom text and coordinate overrides.
- **Draggable UI Overlay**: A fluid city-label overlay with automatic edge-clamping and symmetric safety padding.
- **Background Edge Effects**: Improve readability using soft vignette shading or subtle transparency along the edges.
- **Layout Flexibility**: Independently toggle country names, geographic coordinates, and map labels for a tailored look.
- **Pro-Grade Exports**: Generate high-fidelity PNG files at custom resolutions or ultra-high resolutions (up to 50,000px).
- **Privacy & Performance**: Persistent settings via LocalStorage and 100% client-side rendering, your data never leaves your browser.

## 🎨 Themes

MapToPoster JS offers two distinct ways to style your maps:

### Standard Themes (Leaflet)
Based on high-quality raster tiles from established providers:
- **Minimal White**: Clean and modern (CartoDB Positron).
- **Midnight Dark**: Sleek dark mode (CartoDB Dark Matter).
- **Classic Street**: Standard OpenStreetMap cartography.
- **Modern Voyager**: Colorful and detailed (CartoDB Voyager).
- **Satellite View**: High-resolution imagery (Esri World Imagery).

### Artistic Themes (MapLibre GL)
Hand-crafted vector styles with procedural colors:
- **Arctic Frost**: Pale blues and crisp whites.
- **Aurora Glow**: Iridescent greens and pinks.
- **Cyber Glitch**: Neon accents for a digital look.
- **Paper Heritage**: Vintage sepia tones and inked roads.
- **Volcanic Ash**: Deep charcoal with glowing ember accents.
- **Blueprint Classic**: Technical cyanotype style for an architectural feel.
- ...and many more unique themes like Retro Synth, Charcoal Sketch, and Sakura Bloom.

### Customizing Themes
You can easily add your own artistic themes by editing [src/core/artistic-themes.js](src/core/artistic-themes.js):

1. Open `artistic-themes.js`.
2. Add a new object to the `artisticThemes` export:
```javascript
your_theme_key: {
    name: "Your Theme Name",
    description: "Brief description of the style",
    bg: "#HEXCODE",
    text: "#HEXCODE",
    water: "#HEXCODE",
    parks: "#HEXCODE",
    road_motorway: "#HEXCODE",
    road_primary: "#HEXCODE",
    road_secondary: "#HEXCODE",
    road_default: "#HEXCODE"
}
```
The application will automatically pick up the new theme and display it in the selection menu.

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher
* **npm**: Usually comes with Node.js

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dimartarmizi/map-to-poster.git
   cd map-to-poster
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Optimized files will be generated in the `dist/` folder.

## 🐳 Deploy with Docker

This project is ready to run as a lightweight Docker container using a multi-stage build:

- **Build stage**: Uses Node.js to install dependencies and generate the Vite production build.
- **Runtime stage**: Uses Nginx Alpine to serve the static files from `dist/`.

### Build the image

```bash
docker build -t map-to-poster .
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name map-to-poster map-to-poster
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

### Update deployment

After pulling new changes, rebuild and recreate the container:

```bash
docker build -t map-to-poster .
docker rm -f map-to-poster
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name map-to-poster map-to-poster
```

### Included Docker files

- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage production image
- `.dockerignore` — keeps the build context small
- `docker/nginx.conf` — Nginx config with SPA fallback to `index.html`

## 📜 Technical Overview

1. **Reactive State Management**: Uses an observer-pattern based store ([src/core/state.js](src/core/state.js)) to synchronize changes across the UI, Leaflet, and MapLibre engines. All user preferences are persisted via `localStorage`.
2. **Hybrid Mapping Engine**: Implements bidirectional viewport synchronization between Leaflet (raster tiles) and MapLibre GL (vector themes), ensuring seamless layout consistency regardless of the active rendering mode.
3. **Draggable Overlay System**: Leverages real-time bounding box calculations to clamp label positions, ensuring a symmetric 8px minimum safety gap from the poster edges.
4. **Dynamic Asset Integration**: Manages custom GeoJSON routing and multi-marker instances with interactive drag-and-drop support across both map engines.
5. **Mat Framing Layer**: Implements a virtual "Mat/Passepartout" interface with customizable inset spacing and inner borders for a gallery-style finish.
6. **High-Fidelity Rendering Pipeline**: Captured exports utilize a multi-stage process in [src/core/export.js](src/core/export.js) to generate high-resolution map snapshots using `html2canvas` and the `onclone` callback.
