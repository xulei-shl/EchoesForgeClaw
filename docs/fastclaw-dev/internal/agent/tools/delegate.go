// Registered as SERIAL: two delegate_task calls cannot run
// concurrently within one agent. Sub-agents share the parent's single
// sandbox + single camoufox-cli daemon — running 5 in parallel meant
// they trampled each other's browser navigation state, got back
// snapshots of pages other siblings just navigated to, and produced
// garbage. Serialization trades fan-out wall time (5 × N min instead
// of N min) for actually-correct results.
//
// The tool description explains both the WHY of delegation (parent's
// context stays clean, sub-agent gets a fresh iteration budget) and
// the serial-execution contract so the model doesn't expect parallel
// throughput from fan-out. The "no nesting" line is critical — without
// it flash-tier models try to recursively delegate and burn through
// budgets exponentially.
