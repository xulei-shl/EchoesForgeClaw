# Guardrails

Guardrails enable you to do checks and validations of user input and agent output. For example, imagine you have an agent that uses a very smart (and hence slow/expensive) model to help with customer requests. You wouldn't want malicious users to ask the model to help them with their math homework. So, you can run a guardrail with a fast/cheap model. If the guardrail detects malicious usage, it can immediately raise an error, saving time and money. Blocking execution guarantees that the expensive model does not start; with parallel execution, the expensive model may already have started before the guardrail completes. See "Execution modes" below for details.

There are two kinds of guardrails:

1. Input guardrails run on the initial user input
2. Output guardrails run on the final agent output

## Workflow boundaries

Guardrails are attached to agents and tools, but they do not all run at the same points in a workflow:

-   **Input guardrails** run only for the first agent in the chain.
-   **Output guardrails** run only for the agent that produces the final output.
-   **Tool guardrails** run on every custom function-tool invocation, with input guardrails before execution and output guardrails after execution.

If you need checks before and/or after each custom function-tool call in a workflow that includes managers, handoffs, or delegated specialists, use tool guardrails instead of relying only on agent-level input/output guardrails.

## Input guardrails

Input guardrails run in 3 steps:

1. First, the guardrail receives the same input passed to the agent.
2. Next, the guardrail function runs to produce a [`GuardrailFunctionOutput`][agents.guardrail.GuardrailFunctionOutput], which is then wrapped in an [`InputGuardrailResult`][agents.guardrail.InputGuardrailResult]
3. Finally, we check if [`.tripwire_triggered`][agents.guardrail.GuardrailFunctionOutput.tripwire_triggered] is true. If true, an [`InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`][agents.exceptions.InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered] exception is raised, so you can appropriately respond to the user or handle the exception.

!!! Note

    Input guardrails are intended to run on user input, so an agent's guardrails only run if the agent is the *first* agent. You might wonder, why is the `guardrails` property on the agent instead of passed to `Runner.run`? It's because guardrails tend to be related to the actual Agent - you'd run different guardrails for different agents, so colocating the code is useful for readability.

### Execution modes

Input guardrails support two execution modes:

- **Parallel execution** (default, `run_in_parallel=True`): The guardrail runs concurrently with the agent's execution. This provides the best latency since both start at the same time. However, if the guardrail's tripwire is triggered, the agent may have already consumed tokens and executed tools before being cancelled.

- **Blocking execution** (`run_in_parallel=False`): The guardrail runs and completes *before* the agent starts. If the guardrail tripwire is triggered, the agent never executes, preventing token consumption and tool execution. This is ideal for cost optimization and when you want to avoid potential side effects from tool calls.

## Output guardrails

Output guardrails run in 3 steps:

1. First, the guardrail receives the output produced by the agent.
2. Next, the guardrail function runs to produce a [`GuardrailFunctionOutput`][agents.guardrail.GuardrailFunctionOutput], which is then wrapped in an [`OutputGuardrailResult`][agents.guardrail.OutputGuardrailResult]
3. Finally, we check if [`.tripwire_triggered`][agents.guardrail.GuardrailFunctionOutput.tripwire_triggered] is true. If true, an [`OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`][agents.exceptions.OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered] exception is raised, so you can appropriately respond to the user or handle the exception.

!!! Note

    Output guardrails are intended to run on the final agent output, so an agent's guardrails only run if the agent is the *last* agent. Similar to the input guardrails, we do this because guardrails tend to be related to the actual Agent - you'd run different guardrails for different agents, so colocating the code is useful for readability.

    Output guardrails always run after the agent completes, so they don't support the `run_in_parallel` parameter.

An output tripwire and an exception raised by the guardrail function have different session behavior. A tripwire rejects the candidate final output. When a tripwire fires, the runner asks the configured session to persist already-completed tool call and tool output items, together with any reasoning context required to replay those calls, while excluding the rejected candidate final output. The runner applies this tripwire rule to both streaming and non-streaming runs. When the guardrail function raises an exception instead of returning a tripwire result, the runner treats the verdict as unknown and asks the configured session to persist the completed final-turn items before surfacing the guardrail exception. If that session write also fails, the session write error takes precedence. Streaming runs use the same persistence ordering as non-streaming runs and raise the terminal exception from `stream_events()`. An immediate [`RunResultStreaming.cancel()`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.cancel] call while the output guardrail is running cancels the in-flight guardrail and does not start a final-turn session write.

## Tool guardrails

Tool guardrails wrap **`FunctionTool` instances** and let you validate or block calls to those tools before and after execution. They are configured on the tool itself and run every time that tool is invoked.

- Input tool guardrails run before the tool executes and can skip the call, replace the output with a message, or raise a tripwire.
- Output tool guardrails run after the tool executes and can replace the output or raise a tripwire.
- If a function tool requires approval, input tool guardrails normally run after approval and immediately before execution. Set [`RunConfig.tool_execution`][agents.run.RunConfig.tool_execution] to [`ToolExecutionConfig(pre_approval_tool_input_guardrails=True)`][agents.run.ToolExecutionConfig] when you want those input checks to run before the pending approval interruption is emitted. Calls that pass this pre-approval check are still checked again after approval before the tool executes.
- Tool guardrails apply only to function tools created with [`function_tool`][agents.tool.function_tool]. Handoffs run through the SDK's handoff pipeline rather than the normal function-tool pipeline, so tool guardrails do not apply to the handoff call itself. Hosted tools (`WebSearchTool`, `FileSearchTool`, `HostedMCPTool`, `CodeInterpreterTool`, `ImageGenerationTool`) and built-in execution tools (`ComputerTool`, `ShellTool`, `ApplyPatchTool`, `LocalShellTool`) also do not use this guardrail pipeline, and [`Agent.as_tool()`][agents.agent.Agent.as_tool] does not currently expose tool-guardrail options directly.

See the code snippet below for details.

## Tripwires

If an agent input or output fails a guardrail, the guardrail can signal this with a tripwire. The runner immediately raises an `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` or `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` exception and halts agent execution. Tool guardrails use the corresponding `ToolInputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` and `ToolOutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` exceptions.

For agent-level tripwires, the exception's `guardrail_result` identifies the guardrail that triggered the tripwire. For an input tripwire raised by the runner, `exception.run_data.input_guardrail_results` contains every input guardrail result completed before the run stopped, including the result that triggered the tripwire. Output tripwires provide the equivalent accumulated results through `exception.run_data.output_guardrail_results`.

Tool tripwire exceptions instead expose the triggering `guardrail` and `output` directly. Their `run_data.tool_input_guardrail_results` and `run_data.tool_output_guardrail_results` lists preserve results accumulated from completed turns before the failure; the triggering result is available through the exception's `output`. Other runner-managed failures, such as `MaxTurnsExceeded`, also preserve completed tool guardrail results in these lists. After `stream_events()` raises an exception, the streamed result exposes the same accumulated agent and tool guardrail result lists. `run_data` can be `None` when an exception is raised outside a runner-managed execution path.

## Implementing a guardrail

You need to provide a function that receives input, and returns a [`GuardrailFunctionOutput`][agents.guardrail.GuardrailFunctionOutput]. In this example, we'll do this by running an Agent under the hood.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents import (
    Agent,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    RunContextWrapper,
    Runner,
    TResponseInputItem,
)
from agents.decorators import input_guardrail

class MathHomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_math_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent( # (1)!
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking you to do their math homework.",
    output_type=MathHomeworkOutput,
)


@input_guardrail
async def math_guardrail( # (2)!
    ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], agent: Agent, input: str | list[TResponseInputItem]
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input, context=ctx.context)

    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=result.final_output, # (3)!
        tripwire_triggered=result.final_output.is_math_homework,
    )


agent = Agent(  # (4)!
    name="Customer support agent",
    instructions="You are a customer support agent. You help customers with their questions.",
    input_guardrails=[math_guardrail],
)

async def main():
    # This should trip the guardrail
    try:
        await Runner.run(agent, "Hello, can you help me solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11?")
        print("Guardrail didn't trip - this is unexpected")

    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
        print("Math homework guardrail tripped")
```

1. We'll use this agent in our guardrail function.
2. This is the guardrail function that receives the agent's input/context, and returns the result.
3. We can include extra information in the guardrail result.
4. This is the actual agent that defines the workflow.

Output guardrails are similar.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents import (
    Agent,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    RunContextWrapper,
    Runner,
)
from agents.decorators import output_guardrail
class MessageOutput(BaseModel): # (1)!
    response: str

class MathOutput(BaseModel): # (2)!
    reasoning: str
    is_math: bool

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the output includes any math.",
    output_type=MathOutput,
)

@output_guardrail
async def math_guardrail(  # (3)!
    ctx: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent, output: MessageOutput
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, output.response, context=ctx.context)

    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=result.final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=result.final_output.is_math,
    )

agent = Agent( # (4)!
    name="Customer support agent",
    instructions="You are a customer support agent. You help customers with their questions.",
    output_guardrails=[math_guardrail],
    output_type=MessageOutput,
)

async def main():
    # This should trip the guardrail
    try:
        await Runner.run(agent, "Hello, can you help me solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11?")
        print("Guardrail didn't trip - this is unexpected")

    except OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
        print("Math output guardrail tripped")
```

1. This is the actual agent's output type.
2. This is the guardrail's output type.
3. This is the guardrail function that receives the agent's output, and returns the result.
4. This is the actual agent that defines the workflow.

Lastly, here are examples of tool guardrails.

```python
import json
from agents import (
    Agent,
    Runner,
    ToolGuardrailFunctionOutput,
)
from agents.decorators import tool, tool_input_guardrail, tool_output_guardrail

@tool_input_guardrail
def block_secrets(data):
    args = json.loads(data.context.tool_arguments or "{}")
    if "sk-" in json.dumps(args):
        return ToolGuardrailFunctionOutput.reject_content(
            "Remove secrets before calling this tool."
        )
    return ToolGuardrailFunctionOutput.allow()


@tool_output_guardrail
def redact_output(data):
    text = str(data.output or "")
    if "sk-" in text:
        return ToolGuardrailFunctionOutput.reject_content("Output contained sensitive data.")
    return ToolGuardrailFunctionOutput.allow()


@tool(
    tool_input_guardrails=[block_secrets],
    tool_output_guardrails=[redact_output],
)
def classify_text(text: str) -> str:
    """Classify text for internal routing."""
    return f"length:{len(text)}"


agent = Agent(name="Classifier", tools=[classify_text])
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "hello world")
print(result.final_output)
```
