# Results

When you call the `Runner.run` methods, you receive one of two result types:

-   [`RunResult`][agents.result.RunResult] from `Runner.run(...)` or `Runner.run_sync(...)`
-   [`RunResultStreaming`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming] from `Runner.run_streamed(...)`

Both inherit from [`RunResultBase`][agents.result.RunResultBase], which exposes the shared result surfaces such as `final_output`, `new_items`, `last_agent`, `raw_responses`, and `to_state()`.

`RunResultStreaming` adds streaming-specific controls such as [`stream_events()`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.stream_events], [`current_agent`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.current_agent], [`is_complete`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.is_complete], and [`cancel(...)`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.cancel].

## Choose the right result surface

Most applications only need a few result properties or helpers:

| If you need... | Use |
| --- | --- |
| The final answer to show the user | `final_output` |
| A replay-ready next-turn input list with the full local transcript | `to_input_list()` |
| Rich run items with agent, tool, handoff, and approval metadata | `new_items` |
| The agent that should usually handle the next user turn | `last_agent` |
| OpenAI Responses API chaining with `previous_response_id` | `last_response_id` |
| Pending approvals and a resumable snapshot | `interruptions` and `to_state()` |
| Metadata about the current nested `Agent.as_tool()` invocation | `agent_tool_invocation` |
| Raw model calls or guardrail diagnostics | `raw_responses` and the guardrail result arrays |

## Final output

The [`final_output`][agents.result.RunResultBase.final_output] property contains the final output of the last agent that ran. This is either:

-   a `str`, if the last agent did not have an `output_type` defined
-   an object of type `last_agent.output_type`, if the last agent had an output type defined
-   `None`, if the run stopped before a final output was produced, for example because it paused on an approval interruption

!!! note

    `final_output` is typed as `Any`. Handoffs can change which agent finishes the run, so the SDK cannot statically know the full set of possible output types.

In streaming mode, `final_output` stays `None` until the stream has finished processing. See [Streaming](streaming.md) for the event-by-event flow.

## Input, next-turn history, and new items

These surfaces answer different questions:

| Property or helper | What it contains | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`input`][agents.result.RunResultBase.input] | The base input for this run segment. If a handoff input filter rewrote the history, this reflects the filtered input the run continued with. | Auditing what this run actually used as input |
| [`to_input_list()`][agents.result.RunResultBase.to_input_list] | An input-item view of the run. The default `mode="preserve_all"` keeps the converted history from `new_items`, except it does not append an exact session item occurrence already moved into SDK-default nested handoff history a second time; `mode="normalized"` prefers canonical continuation input when handoff filtering rewrites model history. | Manual chat loops, client-managed conversation state, and plain-item history inspection |
| [`new_items`][agents.result.RunResultBase.new_items] | Rich [`RunItem`][agents.items.RunItem] wrappers with agent, tool, handoff, and approval metadata. | Logs, UIs, audits, and debugging |
| [`raw_responses`][agents.result.RunResultBase.raw_responses] | Raw [`ModelResponse`][agents.items.ModelResponse] objects from each model call in the run. | Provider-level diagnostics or raw response inspection |

In practice:

-   Use `to_input_list()` when you want a plain input-item view of the run.
-   Use `to_input_list(mode="normalized")` when you want the canonical local input for the next `Runner.run(..., input=...)` call after handoff filtering or nested handoff history rewrites.
-   Use [`session=...`](sessions/index.md) when you want the SDK to load and save history for you.
-   If you are using OpenAI server-managed state with `conversation_id` or `previous_response_id`, usually pass only the new user input and reuse the stored ID instead of resending `to_input_list()`.
-   Use the default `to_input_list()` mode or `new_items` when you need the full converted history for logs, UIs, or audits.

When SDK-default nested handoff history preserves a message item verbatim, Sessions, `RunState`, and `to_input_list()` track the exact owned occurrence rather than deduplicating by content. Identical messages that occurred separately remain separate; only the already-owned occurrence is kept from being appended a second time.

Unlike the JavaScript SDK, Python does not expose a separate `output` property containing only the model-format items newly generated during the run. Use `new_items` when you need SDK metadata, or inspect `raw_responses` when you need the raw model payloads.

Resubmitting computer-tool items as conversation input uses the raw Responses payload shape. Preview-model `computer_call` items preserve a single `action`, while `gpt-5.5` computer calls can preserve batched `actions[]`. [`to_input_list()`][agents.result.RunResultBase.to_input_list] and [`RunState`][agents.run_state.RunState] keep whichever shape the model produced, so manually resubmitting those items as conversation input, pause/resume flows, and stored transcripts continue to work across both preview and GA computer-tool calls. Local execution results still appear as `computer_call_output` items in `new_items`.

### New items

[`new_items`][agents.result.RunResultBase.new_items] gives you the richest view of what happened during the run. Common item types are:

-   [`InputItem`][agents.items.InputItem] for input admitted from `RunState.pending_input` immediately before a resumed model call
-   [`MessageOutputItem`][agents.items.MessageOutputItem] for assistant messages
-   [`ReasoningItem`][agents.items.ReasoningItem] for reasoning items
-   [`ToolSearchCallItem`][agents.items.ToolSearchCallItem] and [`ToolSearchOutputItem`][agents.items.ToolSearchOutputItem] for Responses tool search requests and loaded tool-search results
-   [`ToolCallItem`][agents.items.ToolCallItem] and [`ToolCallOutputItem`][agents.items.ToolCallOutputItem] for tool calls and their results
-   [`ToolApprovalItem`][agents.items.ToolApprovalItem] for tool calls that paused for approval
-   [`MCPApprovalRequestItem`][agents.items.MCPApprovalRequestItem], [`MCPApprovalResponseItem`][agents.items.MCPApprovalResponseItem], and [`MCPListToolsItem`][agents.items.MCPListToolsItem] for hosted MCP approvals and tool catalogs
-   [`HandoffCallItem`][agents.items.HandoffCallItem] and [`HandoffOutputItem`][agents.items.HandoffOutputItem] for handoff requests and completed transfers

Choose `new_items` over `to_input_list()` whenever you need agent associations, tool outputs, handoff boundaries, or approval boundaries.

When you use hosted tool search, inspect `ToolSearchCallItem.raw_item` to see the search request the model emitted, and `ToolSearchOutputItem.raw_item` to see which namespaces, functions, or hosted MCP servers were loaded for that turn.

With Programmatic Tool Calling, the generated `program` is a `ToolCallItem`, ordinary child tool calls owned by that program are also `ToolCallItem` entries, and the matching `program_output` is a `ToolCallOutputItem`. Program-owned hosted MCP `mcp_approval_request` and `mcp_list_tools` items are exceptions: they become `MCPApprovalRequestItem` and `MCPListToolsItem` entries.

Raw items can be typed Responses objects or mappings. In particular, program-owned shell and apply-patch calls use mappings. Use a mapping-safe inspection pattern:

```python
from collections.abc import Mapping


def raw_field(item, name):
    raw_item = item.raw_item
    if isinstance(raw_item, Mapping):
        return raw_item.get(name)
    return getattr(raw_item, name, None)


raw_type = raw_field(item, "type")
caller = raw_field(item, "caller")
caller_id = (
    caller.get("caller_id")
    if isinstance(caller, Mapping)
    else getattr(caller, "caller_id", None)
)
```

For a program-owned child call, the `type` field of `caller` is `program`, and `caller_id` identifies the parent program call.

## Continue or resume the conversation

### Next-turn agent

[`last_agent`][agents.result.RunResultBase.last_agent] contains the last agent that ran. This is often the best agent to reuse for the next user turn after handoffs.

In streaming mode, [`RunResultStreaming.current_agent`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.current_agent] updates as the run progresses, so you can observe handoffs before the stream finishes.

### Interruptions and run state

If a tool needs approval, pending approvals are exposed in [`RunResult.interruptions`][agents.result.RunResult.interruptions] or [`RunResultStreaming.interruptions`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.interruptions]. This can include approvals raised by direct tools, by tools reached after a handoff, or by nested [`Agent.as_tool()`][agents.agent.Agent.as_tool] runs.

Call [`to_state()`][agents.result.RunResult.to_state] to capture a resumable [`RunState`][agents.run_state.RunState], approve or reject the pending items, and then resume with `Runner.run(...)` or `Runner.run_streamed(...)`.

When a [`ToolCallOutputItem`][agents.items.ToolCallOutputItem] output is a Pydantic model or dataclass, `RunState` serializes that output as structured data. `RunState` also traverses dictionaries, lists, and tuples and converts Pydantic models or dataclasses that it encounters in those containers; tuples are restored as lists after a JSON round trip. Other non-JSON-compatible values can fall back to their string representation, so return explicitly JSON-compatible data when an exact custom type must survive serialization.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Use tools when needed.")
result = await Runner.run(agent, "Delete temp files that are no longer needed.")

if result.interruptions:
    state = result.to_state()
    for interruption in result.interruptions:
        state.approve(interruption)
    result = await Runner.run(agent, state)
```

#### Add input before resuming

Use [`RunState.add_input()`][agents.run_state.RunState.add_input] when new user input arrives after a run pauses or stops after a completed turn, but before the unfinished run reaches its next model call. A string becomes a user message, and multiple calls preserve insertion order. The staged input is part of serialized `RunState`, so it survives `to_json()` / `from_json()` and `to_string()` / `from_string()` round trips.

```python
state = result.to_state()
state.add_input("Also keep the generated report in the project folder.")

for interruption in state.get_interruptions():
    state.approve(interruption)

result = await Runner.run(agent, state)
```

On resume, the runner applies both the current agent's input guardrails and the input guardrails from [`RunConfig`][agents.run.RunConfig] only to the staged input. When a client-managed [`Session`][agents.memory.session.Session] is configured, the runner converts the accepted staged input into a durable [`InputItem`][agents.items.InputItem] and awaits the session write before issuing the model request. Without a client-managed session or server-managed conversation, the runner converts the accepted staged input into an `InputItem` before issuing the model request. For a server-managed conversation, the input remains pending until the server request accepts it. Across serialization, resume, and replay-safe retries, the SDK preserves one durable `InputItem` occurrence. This SDK occurrence guarantee is not a provider-delivery guarantee: if a retry policy returns `RetryDecision(approve_unsafe_replay=True)` after a request may have reached the provider, the runner can resend the staged input and provider-side work can repeat. Successfully admitted input appears in `new_items` as an `InputItem`. Read [`RunState.pending_input`][agents.run_state.RunState.pending_input] for a detached copy, or call [`RunState.clear_pending_input()`][agents.run_state.RunState.clear_pending_input] to discard all staged input before resuming.

`RunState.add_input()` rejects a terminal state, a state with no remaining model turns, a state in which an accepted model response is awaiting local processing, and an interrupted state whose pending tool result may end the run before another model call. In those cases, finish the current run and start a new user turn instead.

For streaming runs, finish consuming [`stream_events()`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.stream_events] first, then inspect `result.interruptions` and resume from `result.to_state()`. For the full approval flow, see [Human-in-the-loop](human_in_the_loop.md).

### Server-managed continuation

[`last_response_id`][agents.result.RunResultBase.last_response_id] is the latest model response ID from the run. Pass it back as `previous_response_id` on the next turn when you want to continue an OpenAI Responses API chain.

If you already continue the conversation with `to_input_list()`, `session`, or `conversation_id`, you usually do not need `last_response_id`. If you need every model response from a multi-step run, inspect `raw_responses` instead.

## Agent-as-tool metadata

When a result comes from a nested [`Agent.as_tool()`][agents.agent.Agent.as_tool] run, [`agent_tool_invocation`][agents.result.RunResultBase.agent_tool_invocation] exposes immutable metadata about the enclosing `Agent.as_tool()` call:

-   `tool_name`
-   `tool_call_id`
-   `tool_arguments`

For ordinary top-level runs, `agent_tool_invocation` is `None`.

This is especially useful inside `custom_output_extractor`, where you may need the enclosing `Agent.as_tool()` call's tool name, call ID, or raw arguments while post-processing the nested result. See [Tools](tools.md) for the surrounding `Agent.as_tool()` patterns.

If you also need the parsed structured input for that nested run, read `context_wrapper.tool_input`. That is the field [`RunState`][agents.run_state.RunState] serializes generically for nested tool input, while `agent_tool_invocation` exposes metadata for the current nested invocation directly on the result.

## Streaming lifecycle and diagnostics

[`RunResultStreaming`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming] inherits the same result surfaces above, but adds streaming-specific controls:

-   [`stream_events()`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.stream_events] to consume semantic stream events
-   [`current_agent`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.current_agent] to track the active agent mid-run
-   [`is_complete`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.is_complete] to see whether the streamed run has fully finished
-   [`cancel(...)`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming.cancel] to stop the run immediately or after the current turn

Keep consuming `stream_events()` until the async iterator finishes. A streaming run is not complete until that iterator ends, and summary properties such as `final_output`, `interruptions`, `raw_responses`, and session-persistence side effects may still be settling after the last visible token arrives.

If you call `cancel()`, continue consuming `stream_events()` so cancellation and cleanup can finish correctly.

Python does not expose a separate streamed `completed` promise or `error` property. Streaming failures that terminate the run are raised by `stream_events()`, and `is_complete` reflects whether the run has reached its terminal state.

### Raw responses

[`raw_responses`][agents.result.RunResultBase.raw_responses] contains the raw model responses collected during the run. Multi-step runs can produce more than one response, for example across handoffs or repeated model/tool/model cycles.

[`last_response_id`][agents.result.RunResultBase.last_response_id] is just the ID from the last entry in `raw_responses`.

Each [`ModelResponse`][agents.items.ModelResponse] also exposes two diagnostics that apply to that individual model call:

-   [`request_id`][agents.items.ModelResponse.request_id] is the transport request ID when the model adapter and transport propagate one. The built-in `OpenAIResponsesModel` and `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel` propagate an available server-generated `x-request-id` on their HTTP and SSE transport paths. When the configured endpoint is the OpenAI API, log a non-`None` value in production so you can correlate failures with OpenAI support; for an OpenAI-compatible provider or proxy, use that service's support channel instead. `OpenAIResponsesWSModel` currently leaves `request_id` as `None`. Third-party adapters do not guarantee request ID propagation. The AnyLLM Chat Completions adapter and `LitellmModel` currently leave `request_id` as `None`. The Agents SDK AnyLLM Responses adapter may also leave `request_id` as `None` when it normalizes a provider response without preserving the transport request ID.
-   [`raw_usage`][agents.items.ModelResponse.raw_usage] is an opt-in, JSON-compatible snapshot of the provider's usage payload before the Agents SDK normalizes the payload. Enable `raw_usage` with `ModelSettings(preserve_raw_usage=True)`; see [Preserving provider usage payloads](usage.md#preserving-provider-usage-payloads).

`ModelResponse.request_id` and `ModelResponse.raw_usage` can each be `None`, so handle these values as optional diagnostics rather than conversation state.

### Guardrail results

Agent-level guardrails are exposed as [`input_guardrail_results`][agents.result.RunResultBase.input_guardrail_results] and [`output_guardrail_results`][agents.result.RunResultBase.output_guardrail_results].

Tool guardrails are exposed separately as [`tool_input_guardrail_results`][agents.result.RunResultBase.tool_input_guardrail_results] and [`tool_output_guardrail_results`][agents.result.RunResultBase.tool_output_guardrail_results].

These arrays accumulate across the run, so they are useful for logging decisions, storing extra guardrail metadata, or debugging why a run was blocked.

### Context and usage

[`context_wrapper`][agents.result.RunResultBase.context_wrapper] exposes your app context together with SDK-managed runtime metadata such as approvals, usage, and nested `tool_input`.

Usage is tracked on `context_wrapper.usage`. For streamed runs, the usage totals can lag until the stream's final chunks have been processed. See [Context management](context.md) for the full wrapper shape and persistence caveats.
